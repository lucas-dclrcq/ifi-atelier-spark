00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:33,559
- Ow, ow, ow!
- Oh [bleep].

170
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,928
What the hell
is wrong with you two?

171
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,196
I-I-I-I mean you four!

172
00:06:37,198 --> 00:06:38,931
[Both] That hurt!
That was painful.

173
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:41,200
Good, I'm glad it was painful.
You deserve it.

174
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:43,769
I saw you. Y-you're both [burps]
all over the damn place.

175
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:45,938
We've been split for 20 minutes
and your lives

176
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,474
are already scattered
to the quantum [bleep] wind?

177
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:49,976
What the hell do either
of you two

178
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:52,545
have to be so uncertain about?
Your brand of zit cream?

179
00:06:52,547 --> 00:06:54,547
Which chair to sit in
while I do everything?

180
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:56,515
- Come on, spit it out!
- Well, you don't exactly make it easy, Rick.

181
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:58,484
You make fun of me all the time...
You're always picking on me...

182
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:00,820
And now Summer's doing it... and
now you got Summer to kiss your ass.

183
00:07:00,822 --> 00:07:03,222
Me?! What about you? You're just as
mean to me because you're jealous...

184
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:04,319
Could you get more
excited to see me fail?

185
00:07:04,344 --> 00:07:05,491
Because you want
grandpa all to yourself!

186
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:08,160
All right, all right, cool it.
I see what's happening here.

187
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:09,895
You're both young,
you're both unsure

188
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:11,230
about your place
in the universe,

189
00:07:11,232 --> 00:07:13,099
and you both want
to be grandpa's favorite.

190
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:14,734
I can fix this.
Morty, sit here.

191
00:07:14,736 --> 00:07:16,502
Summer, you sit here.
Now, listen.

192
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:18,170
I know the two of you
are very different

193
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:19,438
from each other
in a lot of ways,

194
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,408
but you have to understand that
as far as grandpa's concerned,

195
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,110
you're both pieces of shit.
Yeah.

196
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:25,444
I can prove it mathematically.

197
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,179
Actually, let me
grab my white board.

198
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:28,914
This has been
a long time coming, anyway.

199
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,650
[Tires screech]

200
00:07:30,652 --> 00:07:32,585
Emergency!
Wounded deer coming in.

201
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:34,253
[Air hissing]
Three.

202
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:36,088
Excuse me,
you can't be back here.

203
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,590
I'm a certified horse surgeon,

204
00:07:37,592 --> 00:07:39,525
and this deer
needs medical attention.

205
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:41,861
- Nurse, please move that snake.
- That's <i>my</i> nurse.

206
00:07:41,863 --> 00:07:43,829
And as a horse surgeon,
I'm sure that you know

207
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:47,199
that deer have much smaller,
much more intricate organs.

208
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:49,268
As a vet, I'm sure you know
that a deer

209
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,604
is closer to a horse
than you are to a doctor.

210
00:07:51,606 --> 00:07:54,273
So let's save the measuring
for when our dicks are out.

211
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:55,975
- It's time to save a life!
- Geez.

212
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:57,443
[Grunts, sighs]

213
00:07:57,445 --> 00:07:59,879
That's odd.
This deer's wounded.

214
00:07:59,881 --> 00:08:02,281
Uh, yeah, I was there.
You don't have to rub it in.

215
00:08:02,283 --> 00:08:04,650
I mean it's been shot
with a gun.

216
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,786
[Man] My gun.

217
00:08:06,788 --> 00:08:08,387
May I help <i>you,</i> sir?

218
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:10,322
No, but you can stop
helping this deer.

219
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,558
I shot it before these two
hit it with their car,

220
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,660
and I followed them
when they hauled it off.

221
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:16,295
This deer belongs to me.

222
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:18,297
[Sighs] We don't have time
for this, okay?

223
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:20,166
I need anaesthetic
and deer saline.

224
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:22,134
Look, I don't know what
the law says about this,

225
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:24,804
but I took an oath that I would
let no animal come to harm.

226
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:27,339
Except when sterilizing,
aborting, or euthanizing them,

227
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,308
or also when eating them
at also any meal.

228
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,843
I'm calling my lawyer.

229
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:33,679
I hope for all our sakes you're as
bad a surgeon as I am a hunter.

230
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:35,648
In your dreams, bitch.
Scalpel.

231
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,051
So, in conclusion,
you're both equally mercurial,

232
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:42,988
overly sensitive, clingy,
hysterical, bird-brained homunculi.

233
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,092
And I honestly can't even tell the
two of you apart half the time

234
00:08:46,094 --> 00:08:47,660
because I don't go
by height or age,

235
00:08:47,662 --> 00:08:50,529
I go by amount of pain in my ass,
which makes you both identical.

236
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,164
All right, everything resolved?

237
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,433
Everybody nice and certain about
their position in my world.

238
00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:55,735
- Yes.
- Yes.

239
00:08:55,737 --> 00:08:57,336
All right, perfect.
Sit still.

240
00:08:57,338 --> 00:08:59,271
[Burps] Arms down.
I'm gonna do this again.

241
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:01,273
This time be like grandpa.

242
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:02,441
You mean drunk?

243
00:09:02,443 --> 00:09:04,243
What's that?
You got something to say?

244
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:05,344
- No.
- And away we go!

245
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:07,947
And away we go!

246
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:10,850
- Huh, that's weird.
- Huh, that's weird.

247
00:09:10,852 --> 00:09:12,118
[Button clicking]

248
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,119
- Oh, my God.
- What?

249
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:14,620
- Oh, my God.
- What?

250
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:16,122
- The son of a bitch is gonna kill me!
- What?!

251
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:18,090
- The son of a bitch is gonna kill me!
- What?!

252
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:19,425
Diabolical, unfeeling sociopath.

253
00:09:19,427 --> 00:09:20,926
- Don't you get it?!
- Don't you get it?!

254
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:23,129
The other Rick isn't trying
to merge us anymore.

255
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:25,931
He thinks he can save his own skin
by using the crystal to kill me.

256
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,867
He probably figures
it's [Belches] easier

257
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:30,302
to eliminate one of the possibilities
rather than merge them.

258
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:31,537
[Laughs]
I have to admit,

259
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:33,372
it was always in the back
of my mind, too.

260
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:35,307
The difference is
I would never do it, until now.

261
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,710
- Rick, what the hell are you doing?
- Saving our lives!

262
00:09:37,712 --> 00:09:40,379
After he takes me out, he's...
He's gonna be coming for you.

263
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:41,580
- Who?
- Me!

264
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:42,715
[Gunshot]
Aah!

265
00:09:42,717 --> 00:09:44,416
- Whoa!
- You see that? Get down!

266
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,485
I told you, he's a psycho.
He's lost it!

267
00:09:46,487 --> 00:09:48,587
Th-th-th-the time fracture
must have made him crazy!

268
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,256
- I don't know what to do!
- Oh, crap!

269
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:51,957
I don't know what to do!
[Rumbling]

270
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,425
[Device beeps]

271
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,261
Oh, God,
now there's three of them.

272
00:09:55,263 --> 00:09:57,229
We're outnumbered.
Get in the cupboards.

273
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:58,430
Wait, don't...
don't do that.

274
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,932
They'll know.
Wait, wait.

275
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:02,168
Think about getting in
the cupboards, but don't really.

276
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,936
[Gunshots]
[Screams]

277
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:06,238
Is this what you want,
you sick [bleep]?!

278
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,807
You want to see children die?!

279
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:08,908
You son of a bitch.

280
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,410
You don't stop living
until I say so!

281
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:12,444
Michael.

282
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,913
- Who's this now?
- My lawyer.

283
00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:16,415
I'm here to notify you, ma'am,
that in this county,

284
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:17,983
any deer shot by a hunter

285
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:20,319
is that hunter's property
regardless of how far it runs

286
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:22,188
or who intercepts it
before it dies.

287
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,455
It's called Brad's law.

288
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:24,924
We can't make you
stop the surgery,

289
00:10:24,926 --> 00:10:27,326
but at this point,
you're performing it on venison.

290
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:29,662
Actually,
I've decided not to eat it.

291
00:10:29,664 --> 00:10:33,165
All this fear and conflict...
I'm sure it's ruined the meat.

292
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,601
I'm just gonna use the head
for my rec-room wall.

293
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:37,102
She normally works on horses.

294
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:40,172
Jerry, if you're not gonna help,
get the [bleep] out of here.

295
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:44,109
I will reach into heaven and yank
your screaming deer soul back!

296
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,945
Jesus.

297
00:10:45,947 --> 00:10:47,213
Shh, shh!

298
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:49,114
I know where you are,
you creepy old monster.

299
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:50,449
I know how you think.

300
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:52,451
Oh, is there where
you think I'm going?

301
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:53,986
You think I'm standing here?

302
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:55,221
Well, maybe you're right.

303
00:10:55,223 --> 00:10:56,655
[Morty grunts]
[Rick groans]

304
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,157
[Summer]
Holy [bleep] now what?

305
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,192
Well, if all of me
knocked out all the Ricks,

306
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:01,560
and you peed
in all of your pants,

307
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:03,462
doesn't that mean
that we're all synchronized?

308
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:04,964
- Right.
- Okay.

309
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:07,633
So, from now on, whatever we do,
we have to be certain.

310
00:11:07,635 --> 00:11:08,868
Right.

311
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,737
I think I'm certain
we're effed in the "a".

312
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:14,207
[Cats meowing, purring]

313
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:15,842
Oh, God, my head.

314
00:11:15,844 --> 00:11:17,377
[Groans]
What did you guys do?

315
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:20,513
We put you in a dog crate
because you were acting crazy

316
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:22,582
and you caused
another time fracture.

317
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:23,784
You tried to kill yourself.

318
00:11:23,785 --> 00:11:25,018
O-only in self-defense.

319
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,419
Myself tried to kill me first.

320
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:28,688
Guys, I don't expect you
to understand this,

321
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,523
but time breaking twice
means our problem is

322
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:33,293
two times bigger and we've got
half as much time to solve it.

323
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:35,595
Well, actually, I do expect you
to understand that.

324
00:11:35,597 --> 00:11:38,064
It's basic math. C-can somebody
just let me out of here?

325
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:39,699
If I die in a cage,
I lose a bet.

326
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:41,234
Well, is there some way
you can prove

327
00:11:41,236 --> 00:11:43,136
you're not a threat to yourself
and others anymore?

328
00:11:43,138 --> 00:11:44,871
Oh, for God's sake.
All right, here.

329
00:11:44,873 --> 00:11:46,940
- Give me the time crystal.
- Wh-what are you doing?

330
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:49,109
Calling myself.
Here, listen.

331
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:50,677
It'll [burps] probably go
to voice-mail

332
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,145
since, you know,
I'm calling myself.

333
00:11:52,147 --> 00:11:55,282
<i>- Hello, Rick here.</i>
- Don't fall for it. It's a bit.

334
00:11:55,284 --> 00:11:58,151
<i>Just kidding! Ha, ha!
You just got ricked.</i>

335
00:11:58,153 --> 00:12:00,121
<i>You've reached Rick's voice-mail.
You know what to do. [Beep]</i>

336
00:12:00,223 --> 00:12:01,789
Hey, Rick. It's Rick.

337
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,491
Listen, I'm sorry about earlier.
No hard feelings.

338
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:05,493
I know you know I mean it, too.
Take it easy.

339
00:12:05,895 --> 00:12:07,328
Whoa, damn! Look at this.

340
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,663
I'm blowing up...
Three new voicemails.

341
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:11,764
<i>Hey, Rick. It's Rick.</i>

342
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:13,066
<i>Listen, I'm sorry about earlier.</i>

343
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:14,667
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I heard this one.

344
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:16,002
<i>Hey, Rick. It's Rick.</i>

345
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:17,504
<i>Hey, Rick, it's...</i>
You get the idea.

346
00:12:17,506 --> 00:12:19,139
[Burps] W-we're cool now.

347
00:12:19,141 --> 00:12:20,974
Okay, well, we're still not
gonna let you out of this crate.

348
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:22,408
Fine. I'll just do it myself.

349
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,844
If you could get out that whole
time, why didn't you?

350
00:12:24,846 --> 00:12:26,646
Because I waited
until I was certain

351
00:12:26,648 --> 00:12:28,148
it was what I wanted
to do, Morty.

352
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,083
That's the difference
between you and me.

353
00:12:30,085 --> 00:12:31,317
I'm certain, and you're

354
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:33,820
a walking burlap sack filled
with turds.

355
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:35,155
You know, geez, Rick!

356
00:12:35,157 --> 00:12:36,789
Y-y-you're really tearing
into me right now.

357
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,358
You know, words hurt.

358
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,659
- Holy!
- A monster!

359
00:12:39,661 --> 00:12:41,594
Hey, you... hey, quit yelling.

360
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:43,830
Quit yelling.
What the [bleep]

361
00:12:43,832 --> 00:12:45,665
Your time is all ripped up
to hell!

362
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,667
[Warbles]
You broke your time twice.

363
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:49,669
- [Sighs]
- How did this happen?

364
00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:51,171
[All speaking indistinctly]

365
00:12:51,173 --> 00:12:53,706
Shut the [bleep] up.
Oh, damn.

366
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,475
I'm from the fourth dimension.

367
00:12:55,477 --> 00:12:56,843
I can hear all of y'all.

368
00:12:56,845 --> 00:12:59,045
Now let's just see what we got
here for a second.

369
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:00,848
- [Groans]
- Hey, damn it.

370
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:02,882
Were you trying
to use this to...

371
00:13:02,884 --> 00:13:05,852
Oh, see, you broke time,
and you thought you could

372
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:07,854
just stick it back together
with this?

373
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:09,489
How you think
you gonna move time

374
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:10,890
while you're standing in it,

375
00:13:10,892 --> 00:13:12,692
you dumb-ass three-dimensional
monkey-ass dummies?

376
00:13:12,694 --> 00:13:13,960
Oh, way to go, Rick.

377
00:13:13,962 --> 00:13:15,328
Yeah, grandpa, way to go.

378
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,197
What, you're just gonna listen
to this guy now?

379
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:19,399
He's got a giant testicle
for a head.

380
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:20,667
He came here in a bubble.

381
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:24,070
For all we know, he could be the
David Berkowitz of nutsackland.

382
00:13:24,072 --> 00:13:26,239
Shut up.
Here, put these on.

383
00:13:26,241 --> 00:13:28,074
They'll sync
your possibilities up

384
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:30,143
so I can bring you back
to certain time.

385
00:13:30,145 --> 00:13:32,312
Y'all are just...
Just... just negligent.

386
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:34,147
See, now...
Now look right here.

387
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:36,049
Hey, hey, hey, the three of you,
put your collars on.

388
00:13:36,051 --> 00:13:37,750
- We have them on.
- What are you talking about?

389
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:39,152
- Uh, we did.
- We're not wearing collars.

390
00:13:39,154 --> 00:13:40,987
Exactly.
'Cause you're being obstinate.

391
00:13:40,989 --> 00:13:42,388
[Belches] What?

392
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,357
Put the damn collars on
if you want to live.

393
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:46,326
- They're on right now.
- We did. They're on.

394
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:48,494
All right, fine.
Summer, Morty, put them on.

395
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:49,896
[Device beeps]

396
00:13:49,898 --> 00:13:51,698
[Warbling]

397
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,032
- Yes, we're back!
- No more cats!

398
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:54,901
- We're back in certain time.
- Problem solved.

399
00:13:54,903 --> 00:13:56,169
No more cats!
Oh, you did it!

400
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:58,104
- You fixed it.
- Yeah, I did.

401
00:13:58,106 --> 00:13:59,706
Now keep those
collars on so you

402
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,241
don't break
your weak-ass time again.

403
00:14:01,243 --> 00:14:03,276
How long, exactly, do we have
to wear these things?

404
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:04,744
They're really embarrassing.

405
00:14:04,746 --> 00:14:07,013
Well, since you're going
to time prison,

406
00:14:07,015 --> 00:14:09,115
I'd say you can
keep them on forever.

407
00:14:09,117 --> 00:14:11,050
- Time prison?
- Yeah.

408
00:14:11,052 --> 00:14:13,052
Well, I don't know where you
expect me to think

409
00:14:13,054 --> 00:14:14,420
you got
that crystal over there,

410
00:14:14,422 --> 00:14:18,358
but the only way your dumb-ass
assin' ass asses

411
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,227
could ever have on
is if it was stolen.

412
00:14:21,229 --> 00:14:23,763
You stole a time-freezing
crystal from testicle monsters?!

413
00:14:23,765 --> 00:14:26,432
I would've been happy to pay
for it, s... [burps] Summer,

414
00:14:26,434 --> 00:14:28,468
but they don't exactly sell them
at Costco.

415
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,304
Besides, there's a larger lesson
to be learned here. Get him!

416
00:14:31,306 --> 00:14:32,939
No, no, no, no!
You better keep back!

417
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:34,407
Man, this will turn your ass

418
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:36,743
into a third-trimester fetus
from 30 yards.

419
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:39,245
[Monitor beeping]

420
00:14:39,247 --> 00:14:40,647
Mm.

421
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:43,283
Isn't there a kitten somewhere
that needs a manicure?

422
00:14:43,285 --> 00:14:45,785
That's right, Mrs. Smith.
Give in to your anger.

423
00:14:45,787 --> 00:14:47,920
Neglect that deer.

424
00:14:47,922 --> 00:14:49,822
Honey, it's gonna be okay.

425
00:14:49,824 --> 00:14:51,791
These men are
from the Cervine Institute

426
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:53,293
of elk, moose, deer, and stag.

427
00:14:53,295 --> 00:14:55,295
They can take this deer
to a helicopter

428
00:14:55,297 --> 00:14:57,430
and fly it to the country's
top deer surgeon

429
00:14:57,432 --> 00:14:59,799
on a wildlife reserve
across the state border.

430
00:14:59,801 --> 00:15:02,335
Where your jurisdiction ends.

431
00:15:03,805 --> 00:15:05,738
I guess that's the end of that.

432
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,307
There is just one more thing.

433
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:09,942
According to this state's
veterinarian statute,

434
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:11,811
this animal
can't be transferred

435
00:15:11,813 --> 00:15:13,913
until the current
attending physician

436
00:15:13,915 --> 00:15:18,284
verbally confirms their inability
to provide adequate care.

437
00:15:18,286 --> 00:15:20,486
You heard the man,
horse doctor.

438
00:15:20,488 --> 00:15:24,324
You have to say
you couldn't hack it.

439
00:15:24,326 --> 00:15:26,993
We did it!

440
00:15:26,995 --> 00:15:28,928
Uh-huh. No, mother... no.
Earth, dude.

441
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,264
No, I'm talking about...
Yeah, with the dinosaurs.

442
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:33,933
No, if you get to the dolphin
people, you gone too far.

443
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:36,102
All right, man,
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

444
00:15:36,104 --> 00:15:37,503
You know what they do

445
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:39,439
to third-dimensional life forms
in time prison?

446
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:41,808
Same thing they do in every
other prison, only forever.

447
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,176
Why are you doing this?

448
00:15:43,178 --> 00:15:45,345
You think I want to be
an omniscient immortal being

449
00:15:45,347 --> 00:15:47,513
transcending time and space
my whole life?

450
00:15:47,515 --> 00:15:48,548
I got ambitions, man.

451
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,450
Bringing you guys in
is my ticket up.

452
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:54,854
What if I told you there's a
huge ticket up right behind you?

453
00:15:54,856 --> 00:15:57,690
- You really think I'm that stupid?
- All right, hear me out on this.

454
00:15:57,692 --> 00:15:59,559
You're immortal, right, which
means your life is infinite.

455
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:01,561
Okay, well, then that means
there's a 100% chance

456
00:16:01,563 --> 00:16:03,196
that you'll
eventually do everything,

457
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:05,698
including turning around
to look behind you.

458
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,866
I cannot argue that.

459
00:16:06,868 --> 00:16:08,469
[Thud!]
Aaah!

460
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,970
[Squeals]
Oh, God, gross and weird!

461
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:13,139
Chris!
[Splat!]

462
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:14,507
You killed my gun!

463
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:16,142
[Rick] Summer, Morty,
take off your collars.

464
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:17,643
- What?
- What the hell are you doing?

465
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:22,248
Good question. I suppose
the answer is I'm not certain.

466
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,883
Oh, no, what are you doing?

467
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:25,651
- I have no idea.
- I'm not sure.

468
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:27,086
Stop it!

469
00:16:27,088 --> 00:16:29,555
[Echoing] Maybe I will,
maybe I won't.

470
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:31,858
I'm really uncertain
about everything,

471
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,159
even kicking your ass.

472
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:34,527
List... hey!
Tw... ow!

473
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:36,562
But these arms are vestigial!
[Grunts]

474
00:16:36,564 --> 00:16:38,564
Now, you poked me where
an eye would've been

475
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:40,166
about 6 million years ago.

476
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:42,168
[Summer] [Echoing] Come on,
let's help grandpa.

477
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,604
[Morty] [Echoing] Yes! I'm 100%
not sure about anything!

478
00:16:44,606 --> 00:16:46,339
Yeah, totally uncertain.

479
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:48,174
Beat his ass!
Get him! Beat him up!

480
00:16:48,176 --> 00:16:50,610
- Kick his ass, Rick!
- Die, mother[bleep]!

481
00:16:50,612 --> 00:16:52,011
Ow! I'm defeated.

482
00:16:52,013 --> 00:16:54,013
- What's happening?
- Time is falling apart.

483
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,548
We've got to get back
to certainty quick.

484
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,883
Give me your collars.

485
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:58,918
Oh, man. Don't you have to fix,
like, 30 of them?

486
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,286
Morty, I have to fix three
of them.

487
00:17:00,288 --> 00:17:01,854
And then there's 31
other versions of me

488
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:04,524
that have to also fix three,
for a total of 96.

489
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:06,926
I'm not an idiot.
I know how to be decisive.

490
00:17:06,928 --> 00:17:08,861
- Now hand me that flat-head screwdriver.
- Now hand me that Phillips screwdriver.

491
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,930
- Actually, make it a flat-head.
- Actually, make it a Phillips.

492
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:12,532
Oh, shit.

493
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:15,968
Look, I know I was
kind of a nuisance today.

494
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,603
I know it's my fault
we hit the deer.

495
00:17:17,605 --> 00:17:20,039
And I know you wanted
to be the one to save it.

496
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,541
Whatever.

497
00:17:21,543 --> 00:17:23,976
How petty would I have to be
to care less

498
00:17:23,978 --> 00:17:26,145
about an animal's life
than my own ego?

499
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:29,248
Well, you'd have
