- Yeah, sometimes we'll do classic stuff.

You know, other times,
we'll do whatever!

Sometimes we won't even do anything!

Rick and Morty do... not doing anything!

527
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,359

- whatever the [BLEEP] you want, Morty.
- Sometimes just relaxing.

536
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,629
- That's the end.
- Wait, wait, what the [BLEEP]?

537

H-Hold on. What the
[BLEEP] did you just say?

538
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,059
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
