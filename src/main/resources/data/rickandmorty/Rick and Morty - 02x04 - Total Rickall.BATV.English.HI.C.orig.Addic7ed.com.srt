00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:35,628
That's it.
Photos.

172
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,896
Hard evidence.

173
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:39,665
You're not in any of my photos,
Mr. Poopybutthole.

174
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:41,667
Well, what do you know
about this?

175
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:44,170
You're not in any of mine.

176
00:06:44,172 --> 00:06:48,107
All I have are pictures of me
and my friends from school.

177
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:50,943
What? What teenage girl
has pictures of her family?

178
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:52,611
It's not like we're mormon
or dying.

179
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:55,781
I will admit it's suspicious
that Summer's only friend

180
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:58,818
is a magic ballerina lamb
that we've never seen.

181
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,452
Summer!

182
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:01,954
Tinkles!

183
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:04,123
It's past my bedtime.
[Giggles]

184
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,192
Not in never past bedtime land!

185
00:07:06,194 --> 00:07:08,127
Here we go!

00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:11,197

- Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
- Summer, we're trying to sleep.

196
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:35,654
It was Tinkles!

197
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:36,689
Tinkles?

198
00:07:36,691 --> 00:07:38,324
That is su-- [Belches]--
Suspicious.

199
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:40,292
We're always hearing about
this Tinkles character,

200
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,994
- but we never get to--
- Hi, everybody.

201
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:44,163
I'm Tinkles,
and these are my friends.

202
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:45,331
[All sigh]

203
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,999
See, everyone?
Tinkles is real.

204
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:48,334
That means so am I.

205
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:50,502
- Sorry, Summer.
- Man, I'm sorry, Summer.

206
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:53,239
I was on the wrong side
of the pitchfork on this one.

207
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:56,008
Okay, look, we shouldn't need
evidence or logic

208
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,143
to know who's family
and who isn't.

209
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,678
I know who the Smiths are.

210
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,914
I've known Beth
since high school.

211
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:06,018
And her husband, Sleepy Gary, is
hands down my absolute best friend.

212
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,253
Thanks, Jerry.

213
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:10,522
Beyond that, no offense to any
of you, but all bets are off.

214
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,858
Look, I'm not used to being
this unsure for this long.

215
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,727
I'm just gonna aim for shoulders
starting with the weird girl.

216
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:15,928
Aah!

217
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,997
- Grandpa Rick!
- Hold still, "Summer".

218
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:20,232
Rick, that is my daughter.

219
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:22,701
Oh, yeah? Well, what if you just
think that, Sleepy Gary?

220
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:25,204
I've known you for 15 years.
Don't make me hurt you.

221
00:08:25,206 --> 00:08:27,506
Rick, these are
our family and friends,

222
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,375
the people we barbecue with.

223
00:08:29,377 --> 00:08:31,377
Have you forgotten
the barbecue?

224
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:32,678
Wait, why would you want me to--

225
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,113
You're one of them, aren't you?

226
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:37,116
Rick. You love
those barbecues, Rick.

227
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:38,684
You <i>love</i> them.
Hai!

228
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:39,718
Remember it, Rick?

229
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,288
Shut up, Hamurai!
Shut up, Amish Cyborg!

230
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,056
What is this?
'90s Conan?

231
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:46,025
All:
Remember the barbecue.

232
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:47,359
Remember the barbecue.

233
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:48,894
Remember the barbecue.

234
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:51,263
[Chatter]
You know what, Pencilvester?

235
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:53,399
It took me my whole life
to realize it,

236
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:54,867
but I love barbecuing.

237
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:56,702
- You're good at it, Rick.
- Watch me, baby.

238
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,737
I'm like Tom Cruise from,
um, "Cuisine"

239
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:01,540
or w-whatever that movie's
called where he makes drinks.

240
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:02,775
Yeah, check me out.

241
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:04,743
I'm like Tom Cruise
from "Cuisine".

242
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:05,744
[Chuckles]
Yeah.

243
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,446
Is that what it's called?
"Cuisine"?

244
00:09:07,448 --> 00:09:08,814
Wow!
Hey, everybody.

245
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:11,283
Let's give it up
for the grillmaster Rick!

246
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:12,484
Rick!
Rick! Rick!

247
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:16,422
[All chanting "Rick"]

248
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:17,957
Wait.

249
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:20,793
[Breathing heavily]

250
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:22,094
Noooooo!

251
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:23,295
Shoot. Now look.

252
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:25,731
It's like a "Where's Waldo?" page.
Can you find me?

253
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,266
Check out
all these zany characters.

254
00:09:27,268 --> 00:09:29,568
We'll be right back
after these messages.

255
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,572
I think you should
put down the gun

256
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:33,907
and we should get you
to a doctor.

257
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:35,775
What do you say we take down
these blast shields?

258
00:09:35,777 --> 00:09:37,544
- All: Yeah.
- I can't do that, Sleepy Gary.

259
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:38,845
All right,
everybody listen to me.

260
00:09:38,847 --> 00:09:40,547
I don't know
if any of you guys are real,

261
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:42,549
but this house has been infested
with fake loved ones

262
00:09:42,551 --> 00:09:43,950
that spread
through fake memories,

263
00:09:43,952 --> 00:09:45,952
and our planet will be destroyed
if they get out.

264
00:09:45,954 --> 00:09:47,187
[Grunts]

265
00:09:47,189 --> 00:09:51,458
But, Rick, even you have to admit
you do tend to overreact to stuff.

266
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,261
You guys, we got to hurry.
I just got back from Walmart.

267
00:09:54,263 --> 00:09:56,963
They're selling Nintendo 3DS
systems for $149.99 on sale,

268
00:09:56,965 --> 00:09:59,566
plus every time you buy one,
you get a $50 gift card.

269
00:09:59,568 --> 00:10:01,734
Brings the total price down
to $110 after tax.

270
00:10:01,736 --> 00:10:04,104
Now, listen, we can flip
those sons of bitches

271
00:10:04,106 --> 00:10:05,472
for 230 bucks apiece easy!

272
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:07,474
They're all limited-edition
"Zelda" ones.

273
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:08,942
Hurry! Hurry!
Come with me!

274
00:10:08,944 --> 00:10:11,244
We can be rich,
and we also all get to keep one

275
00:10:11,246 --> 00:10:12,812
and we can play
Nintendo games!

276
00:10:12,814 --> 00:10:14,981
Nintendo, give me free stuff.

277
00:10:14,983 --> 00:10:17,484
Okay, yes,
I definitely remember doing that,

278
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:19,319
but also,
I would never do that.

279
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:20,787
Don't overreact, Rick.

280
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:23,056
- Sleepy Gary, a word?
- Sure, Jerry.

281
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:24,657
Rick, keep a level head, okay?

282
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:27,427
'Cause I'll tell you a secret
about Frankenstein--

283
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:31,431
He's actually
Frankenstein's monster.

284
00:10:33,234 --> 00:10:36,803
Sleepy Gary, my head is filled
with memories of our friendship.

285
00:10:36,805 --> 00:10:40,507
I'm convinced that you're Beth's
husband and I'm your friend,

286
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,842
but if those memories
can't be trusted, then...

287
00:10:42,844 --> 00:10:43,943
Jerry, just say it.

288
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:47,347
Sleepy Gary,
how do we know <i>I'm</i> real?

289
00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:48,848
Jesus, Jerry.

290
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,085
No, you're real.
Hey, look at me.

291
00:10:52,087 --> 00:10:53,753
Now, I don't know
which way is up out there,

292
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:56,523
but I know us,
and you're real, Jerry.

293
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:58,491
Remember our vacation?

294
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:03,295
They're filming that new
"Star Wars" movie down the coast.

295
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:06,766
- Should we check it out?
- Sure. Why not?

296
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,409
Maybe we'll see Chewbacca.

297
00:11:16,811 --> 00:11:19,579
I'd like that.

298
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:23,616
[Moaning]

299
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:28,090
What are we doing?

300
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:35,728
I don't give a damn
what else happens out there.

301
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,631
You and I
are going to survive this.

302
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:39,999
Okay.

303
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:43,236
Hey, we agreed.
Never in the house.

304
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,573
That's a cool watch there, Rick.
Can I check it out?

305
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:49,175
Uh, no thank--
[Grunts]

306
00:11:49,177 --> 00:11:50,376
Okay.

307
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:52,879
Trying to figure out how to
lower the blast shields, huh?

308
00:11:52,881 --> 00:11:54,614
Anybody here
think it's suspicious

309
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:57,083
that a lot of people in here
can't wait to get <i>out</i> of here?

310
00:11:57,085 --> 00:12:00,753
Ah, you're paranoid, Rick.
You've been paranoid since 'nam.

311
00:12:00,755 --> 00:12:02,088
So, what are you gonna do

312
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,723
when you rotate back
to the world, Frankenstein?

313
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:06,292
Shi-i-i-i-t.
I'mma bust a--

314
00:12:06,294 --> 00:12:08,728
[grunts] No!
Get out of my head, parasite!

315
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,929
- No!
- Drop it.

316
00:12:09,931 --> 00:12:11,597
Give me the gun, Frankenstein!

[Indistinct shouting]

318
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:15,701
Give it back!

319
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:17,637
Yeah!
[Applause]

320
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,272
Frankenstein!

321
00:12:19,274 --> 00:12:21,140
[Breathing heavily]
Is anyone here even real?

322
00:12:21,142 --> 00:12:22,542
Am I the only real person
on Earth?!

323
00:12:22,544 --> 00:12:23,810
Reverse Giraffe:
Maybe.

324
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:25,945
Or maybe, just maybe,
we're all real.

325
00:12:25,947 --> 00:12:27,880
You know me.
I'm Reverse Giraffe.

326
00:12:27,882 --> 00:12:29,649
I have a short neck and legs.

327
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:31,717
- I went to college with Hamurai.
- Hai!

328
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:33,820
I saved Ghost in a Jar's life
in Vietnam.

329
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:35,988
- Boo rah!
- And, Beth, how many times

330
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,890
have I been a shoulder
for you to cry on?

331
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:39,759
[Sighs]
Too many.

332
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:41,661
Okay,
so maybe we're just all fake.

333
00:12:41,663 --> 00:12:43,062
That don't make no sense!

334
00:12:43,064 --> 00:12:45,231
Or maybe there's only one
deceiver here--

335
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:47,066
The person that
keeps telling us

336
00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:49,502
the path to salvation
is being held prisoner

337
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:50,970
and mistrusting each other.

338
00:12:50,972 --> 00:12:52,305
Hey, don't blame me!

339
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:53,906
