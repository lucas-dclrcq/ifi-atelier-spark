00:13:57,474 --> 00:13:59,008
- He's going to eat it!
- He's protecting it!

347
00:13:59,042 --> 00:13:59,809
[Shrills]

348
00:13:59,843 --> 00:14:01,444
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

349
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,981
[Humming]
Whoa!

350
00:14:05,015 --> 00:14:06,649
Unity, this place is a mess.

351
00:14:06,683 --> 00:14:07,783
Oh, it's cool.

352
00:14:07,818 --> 00:14:10,186
The part of me that's the cleaning
lady is coming on Friday.

353
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,021
[Gasps] Oh, my god.
I have a meeting

354
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:13,956
at the Galactic Federation
in an hour.

355
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:16,492
Oh, I'll never make it.
Ah, I'll push it to next week.

356
00:14:16,526 --> 00:14:18,494
Unity, could you get
Rick out here, please?

357
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:20,129
He's unavailable.
He's...

358
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:22,098
Having sex with you.
We get it. Gross.

359
00:14:22,132 --> 00:14:23,232
Get him out here now.

360
00:14:23,267 --> 00:14:24,400
I don't think he wants to be--

361
00:14:24,434 --> 00:14:26,535
- Grandpa Rick!
- Rick! Rick!

362
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,304
I'm gonna tell mom and dad
about the gagoo

363
00:14:28,338 --> 00:14:29,805
you have locked up
under the garage!

364
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,341
[Belches] What the hell is
your problem?

365
00:14:32,376 --> 00:14:34,510
Grandpa, we need
to go home, now.

366
00:14:34,544 --> 00:14:36,345
Fine. Sheesh.

367
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,780
[Glass shatters]

368
00:14:37,814 --> 00:14:39,048
[Beeps]

369
00:14:39,082 --> 00:14:40,349
See you.

370
00:14:40,384 --> 00:14:42,051
Uh, Rick, I think
we should allgo.

371
00:14:42,085 --> 00:14:44,387
Tend to your garden, kids.
I'm kind of doing a thing here.

372
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:46,622
[Laughs] Whoo!

373
00:14:46,657 --> 00:14:48,591
Grandpa Rick, we're not
leaving without you.

374
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,559
Oh, my god, you guys.
I get it.

375
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:52,728
You're afraid the big,
bad hive mind

376
00:14:52,763 --> 00:14:54,764
is gonna steal
your grandpa away.

377
00:14:54,798 --> 00:14:55,412
Actually, no.

378
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:58,234
I think Unity's great and you're
a horrible influence on it.

379
00:14:58,268 --> 00:14:59,902
- What?
- This isn't healthy, Rick.

380
00:14:59,937 --> 00:15:02,571
You know, you're really
up to no good

381
00:15:02,606 --> 00:15:04,707
around here a-at this place,
you know?

382
00:15:04,741 --> 00:15:07,677
You and Unity are like...
like leggings and mid-calf boots.

383
00:15:07,711 --> 00:15:09,078
You think you're great together,

384
00:15:09,112 --> 00:15:11,714
but you're just bringing out
the worst in each other.

385
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:14,283
Oh, gee.
Boy, Summer. Well put.

386
00:15:14,318 --> 00:15:16,252
Uh, why don't we see
what Unity thinks?

387
00:15:16,286 --> 00:15:17,553
Unity?

388
00:15:17,587 --> 00:15:19,355
I'm just taking a little break
from stuff.

389
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:21,324
You know?
I need to relax.

390
00:15:21,358 --> 00:15:23,526
Oh, hey, w-what's this on the
news, guys?

391
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,860
Let me turn it up.

392
00:15:24,895 --> 00:15:27,830
In the news today,
this looks a lot worse than it is.

393
00:15:27,864 --> 00:15:29,498
We're really just having a
good time.

394
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:30,866
- Karen?
- Thanks, Todd.

395
00:15:30,901 --> 00:15:34,503
Up next, are you a concerned
grandchild or just a buzzkill?

396
00:15:34,538 --> 00:15:36,405
We'll tell you how you can
know for sure.

397
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,441
I think you two are a little
outnumbered.

398
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:40,576
Okay, well, what if
you did it for me?

399
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,680
What if you came with us as a
favor to us because you love us?

400
00:15:44,715 --> 00:15:46,349
What?
Dumb. Bye.

401
00:15:46,383 --> 00:15:47,750
But Rick, Summer's just---

402
00:15:47,784 --> 00:15:49,552
Summer's just a
hyper-emotional, needy little--

403
00:15:49,586 --> 00:15:51,120
What's the word I'm
looking for here?

404
00:15:51,154 --> 00:15:52,555
Uh... Human.

405
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:53,656
It runs in the family.

406
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,225
I can tolerate it,
but I can't give a crap about it.

407
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:57,660
Take a hike.

408
00:15:57,694 --> 00:16:00,930
Take care of yourself, Unity.

409
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,168
I'm not looking for judgment,
just a yes or no...

410
00:16:06,203 --> 00:16:08,104
can you assimilate a giraffe?

411
00:16:08,138 --> 00:16:09,703
- You're the worst!
- No, you're the worst!

412
00:16:09,728 --> 00:16:12,241
You don't support this family!
All you care about is yourself!

413
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:14,243
- is about supporting you emotionally...
- You've got two children...

414
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:16,445
- ...but you're unsupportable.
- ...Being dragged across the cosmos...

415
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,647
- ...because it's never enough, Jerry!
- ...By your dangerously ill father!

416
00:16:18,682 --> 00:16:21,017
And you force me to watch it happen because
you'd rather lose them and lose me...

417
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:23,486
And you don't even know what it's like to be
afraid of losing anything ...Than lose him!

418
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,088
- Because you cling and you cling
- Because you're the child, Beth!

419
00:16:26,123 --> 00:16:29,291
You, not me! You!
[Screeches]

420
00:16:29,326 --> 00:16:30,760
- Aah!
- Aah!

421
00:16:30,794 --> 00:16:32,328
- Oh, my god.
- Aah!

422
00:16:32,362 --> 00:16:34,030
[Both sigh]

423
00:16:35,932 --> 00:16:37,633
[Both gasp]

424
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:39,902
Um, first of all, hello.

425
00:16:39,936 --> 00:16:42,138
Uh, my name is Blim Blam the
Korblok.

426
00:16:42,172 --> 00:16:43,806
Second of all, cards
on the table,

427
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,674
I'm a murderer that eats babies,

428
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:48,144
and I came to this planet to
eat babies.

429
00:16:48,178 --> 00:16:52,214
However, I am also carrying a
highly infectious disease

430
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:56,585
that I suppose you could call
"space AIDS" as you put it.

431
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,889
And Rick did chain me up so that
he could attempt to cure it.

432
00:16:59,923 --> 00:17:01,891
At the same time,

433
00:17:01,925 --> 00:17:03,926
Rick's motivation
to cure my disease

434
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,028
was not to save my life or
anyone else's,

435
00:17:06,063 --> 00:17:09,298
but to patent and sell the cure
for billions of blemflarcks.

436
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:12,868
But you know the reason why I
ripped my chains out of the wall?

437
00:17:12,903 --> 00:17:15,738
And do you know why I'm never
coming back to this planet?

438
00:17:15,772 --> 00:17:19,742
Because the two of you
are the [bleep] worst!

439
00:17:19,776 --> 00:17:22,311
You both hate yourselves
and each other.

440
00:17:22,345 --> 00:17:26,315
And the idea that it has anything
to do with Rick is laughable.

441
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,584
I'd laugh,
but I'm biologically incapable.

442
00:17:28,618 --> 00:17:30,219
That's how alien I am.

443
00:17:30,253 --> 00:17:32,855
And even I'm sitting here
listening to the two of you

444
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:35,758
and being like,
"What the [beep]"?

445
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:37,927
So good luck with
your shitty marriage,

446
00:17:37,961 --> 00:17:41,297
and tell Rick I'm sorry he has
to deal with either of you.

447
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:43,732
Blim Blam out.

448
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,337
[Gurgles]

449
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:50,039
You know what?
I'm taking this.

450
00:17:54,554 --> 00:17:57,256
How do you--
What is this?

451
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:02,361
Uh, is there a slow setting?

452
00:18:02,396 --> 00:18:05,598
Best door ever.

453
00:18:08,335 --> 00:18:12,738
Rick:
[Belches, sighs, coughs]

454
00:18:12,773 --> 00:18:15,942
Okay, okay. Now make them cry,
but happy crying.

455
00:18:15,976 --> 00:18:18,110
Now make them all make fun of
the blonde one.

456
00:18:18,145 --> 00:18:19,645
Now make them all
do it on the table.

457
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,081
I can't believe you created a
whole show for me.

458
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:23,549
Now cancel it.

459
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:24,817
Okay, now put it back on.

460
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:25,952
[Laughs]

461
00:18:25,986 --> 00:18:27,253
All right, I'm bored.

462
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:30,289
Rick, is there a way for you
to call Summer and Morty?

463
00:18:30,324 --> 00:18:32,925
- I feel bad that they--
- Pbht. Screw those guys.

464
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,227
Ugh. I'll be right back.

465
00:18:35,262 --> 00:18:37,296
Don't waste your brain on
those weirdos, Unity.

466
00:18:37,331 --> 00:18:39,865
They're no different from any of the
aimless chumps that you occupy.

467
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:42,601
They just put you at the center of
their lives because you're powerful.

468
00:18:42,636 --> 00:18:44,170
And then because
they put you there,

469
00:18:44,204 --> 00:18:45,571
they want you to
be less powerful.

470
00:18:45,605 --> 00:18:46,806
Never gonna happen though,
right?

471
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,974
ALL: Never.

472
00:18:48,008 --> 00:18:50,076
Never.
Back in a flash.

473
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,477
[Door whooshes]

474
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:55,047
[Toilet flushes]

475
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:56,949
Best weekend ever, Rick.

476
00:18:56,984 --> 00:19:00,419
I agree, Rick. Let's see how
long we can go.

477
00:19:00,454 --> 00:19:03,489
Hey, Une.
You got any more--

478
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:08,027
Female president: Rick, forgive
me for doing this in notes.

479
00:19:08,061 --> 00:19:10,296
I'm not strong enough to do it
in persons.

480
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,632
Delivery guy: I realize now
that I'm attracted to you

481
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:16,135
for the same reason I
can't be with you.

482
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:17,603
You can't change.

483
00:19:17,637 --> 00:19:19,939
Beggar: And I have no problem
with that,

484
00:19:19,973 --> 00:19:22,808
but it clearly means I have a
problem with myself.

485
00:19:22,843 --> 00:19:25,011
Newspaper vendor: I'm sure there's
no perfect version of me.

486
00:19:25,045 --> 00:19:28,180
I'm sure I'll just unify
species after species

487
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:29,882
and never really be complete.

488
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,718
Female president: But I know
how it goes with us.

489
00:19:32,753 --> 00:19:35,121
I lose who I am and become
part of you.

490
00:19:35,155 --> 00:19:36,722
Because in a strange way,

491
00:19:36,757 --> 00:19:39,258
you're better at what I do
without even trying.

492
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:44,730
Yours, and nobody else's, Unity.

493
00:19:44,765 --> 00:19:47,666
P.S., I don't know where those
coal miners were

494
00:19:47,701 --> 00:19:48,734
before they were assimilated.

495
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:50,469
You might want to get checked.

496
00:19:50,504 --> 00:19:51,537
MAN: [Belches] [Laughter]

497
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:53,739
[Door opens, closes]

498
00:19:53,774 --> 00:19:55,908
Hey.

499
00:19:55,942 --> 00:19:57,309
Dad.

500
00:19:58,378 --> 00:20:01,847
[Clears throat]
I, um Jerry and I

501
00:20:01,882 --> 00:20:04,450
were looking for
our weed whacker

502
00:20:04,484 --> 00:20:07,219
and found your subterranean lair

503
00:20:07,254 --> 00:20:11,590
and your alien prisoner,
and he got away.

504
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,092
And I know I sound like mom,

505
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:14,927
but I can't sacrifice this
whole family's safety

506
00:20:14,961 --> 00:20:16,862
just because I'm afraid you'll
leave again,

507
00:20:16,897 --> 00:20:18,731
so no more alien prisoners

508
00:20:18,765 --> 00:20:23,235
and no more subterranean
excavation without consulting us.

509
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,171
- Okay.
- Okay?

510
00:20:25,205 --> 00:20:28,274
"Okay" like you're gonna
quietly teleport somewhere

511
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:30,709
- and never come back?
- No. It's your house.

512
00:20:30,744 --> 00:20:34,046
Grandpa Rick, what happened
with Unity?

513
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:36,582
Who? Oh, Unity.
Yeah, well...
