1
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:27,428
Jerry!
Jerry, come on!

2
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,005
We got to go!
You got to come with me, Jerry!

3
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,431
Rick?
It's important, Jerry.

4
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,333
The fate of the galaxy
rests on your shoulders.

5
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,834
Let's go.
Put some pants on.

6
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,679
N-Never mind, there's no time
for pants, Jerry.

7
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,247
I'll make you a pair of pants
on the way.

8
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:39,173
It's a Rick and Jerry
adventure!

9
00:00:39,207 --> 00:00:40,941
Rick and Jerry episode!

10
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:15,376
Then I thought,
"Hey, what about Jerry?

11
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,245
He's... He's good
with regular folk."

12
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:19,480
This is a real situation
where... where...

13
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,081
Where Jerry
could really shine.

14
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:22,650
"He's a master convincer."

15
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:25,153
Rick, I'm not an idiot.
I know what this is.

16
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:26,787
Oh. Okay, well,
I told Morty,

17
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,123
"Look, parents get divorced.
They get sad. He'll be fine,"

18
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:31,992
but I think he's worried
you're gonna, you know... Pbht!

19
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,470
And you know how Morty gets
when he gets emotional.

20
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:34,995
It impedes my work.

21
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,840
So, I told him I'd take you out
and give you a win.

22
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:38,466
Wait. My son asked you
to take me

23
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:40,334
on some kind of
pity adventure

24
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:41,835
to keep me
from killing myself?

25
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:43,304
Wait, w-what
did you think it was?

26
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:44,838
An execution.

27
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:46,974
Geez!
You really do need a win.

28
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,442
No!
I-I don't know.

29
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:50,019
I mean, you never made me
the pants, so...

30
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,579
So, you thought
I was gonna drive you

31
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:52,746
into the middle
of the galaxy

32
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,191
and shove you
into the vacuum of space

33
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:55,449
with your dick
hanging out?

34
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:56,626
And we're seeing
how you'd act

35
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,985
if that were
about to happen?

36
00:01:58,018 --> 00:01:59,696
I mean shit I'll make you
the pants right now.

37
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,097
Take me two seconds
to make you pants.

38
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,666
I have pants at home!
Jerry, if I make pants,

39
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,301
they'll be better than
your pants at home.

40
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:05,593
Also, if I wanted
to kill you...

41
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,295
Yeah, I get it.
It would be amazing.

42
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:08,596
Please, take me home.

43
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,207
I'll tell my son we had
an amazing adventure.

44
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:11,499
Well, if it's
all the same,

45
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:12,709
could we go
get our story straight?

46
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,368
Because
you're a terrible liar.

47
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:15,936
You called me
a master convincer!

48
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,371
You believed me?

49
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,545
Huh. This seems...
kind of fancy.

50
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,290
Jerry, for all you know,
this is the equivalent

51
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:27,548
of an alien truck stop.

52
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:28,849
You have
no frame of reference.

53
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,394
You're in a universe
beyond your imagining.

54
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:32,453
But, yes,
it is super fancy.

55
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,997
I mean, my job here is
to make Morty happy.

56
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:35,889
I'm not gonna take you
somewhere dangerous.

57
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,058
Rick Sanchez.

58
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,361
I told you if I ever saw
your face in here again,

59
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,905
I would stick you
like the pig you are.

60
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:45,165
Shnoopy Bloopers,
I told you if you tried...

61
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,835
There'd be two funerals.

62
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,803
Aaah!!

63
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,306
Someone?

64
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,209
Uh, someone?
Someone!

65
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,748
My friend!
It has been too long.

66
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,350
Oh, it's great
to see you again, buddy!

67
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:04,585
Yeah, you're doing it.

68
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:06,420
Mr. Sanchez gets
anything he wants!

69
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:08,422
The resort's covered
in an immortality field.

70
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:10,190
You can't die here.
That's the gimmick.

71
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:15,496
Okay, but still...
Bad parenting.

72
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,265
Hey, rich a-holes are
rich a-holes.

73
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:18,699
They all pay top dollar
to come here

74
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,568
and enjoy a consequence-free
vacation.

75
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,270
No death, no disease,
no dismemberment.

76
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,614
Can't even have
a heart attack.

77
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,073
Got it.
The perfect place

78
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:27,751
to take the most fragile being
in the universe.

79
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:29,510
I can tell you expect me
to refute that,

80
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,711
but it's
right on the money.

81
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:31,945
If I come home
without you,

82
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,681
I doubt Morty's gonna
let me off the hook.

83
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,625
Yeah, but what if you came home
with Jeff Goldblum.

84
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:36,917
Jeff Goldblum?

85
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,362
What the fuck are you
talking about, Jerry?

86
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:40,120
Jesus!

87
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,722
Holy fucking shit!

88
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,257
Yo, what's up,
"Big Chill"?!

89
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,925
Don't go
into the telepod!

90
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,971
Hey, maybe we would have fun
on a fake adventure.

91
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,730
On a fake adventure.

92
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,565
Speaking of...
What are we gonna tell Morty?

93
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,066
I don't know.
But whatever it is,

94
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,403
we're gonna need a couple more
of these babies!

95
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:59,373
What's wrong?

96
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:01,409
Mom,
do you think I'm hot?

97
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:05,078
I... don't think that's something
that matters.

98
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,314
So, I'm not hot?!

99
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:08,749
I'm saying the part of you
that cares about that

100
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,551
is a part you shouldn't
give any energy to.

101
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,919
That's not an answer!

102
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,721
Because I'm not an issue
of Cosmo, okay?

103
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,222
I'm your mother
and a doctor, and...

104
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,557
I'm hideous!

105
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,226
Geez.
What's with her?

106
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,661
Teenage-girl stuff.

107
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,831
Is that a...
hoof collage?

108
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:27,100
It's perfectly legal, if that's
what you're wondering.

109
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,737
Cool... zies.

110
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,606
"We just don't have anything
in common any more, Summer."

111
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,007
Oh, yeah, Ethan?

112
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,976
What do you have in common
with Tricia Lange?

113
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,845
A mutual love
of French cinema?

114
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,313
The belief
that a carbon tax

115
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:42,182
is the only viable solution
to climate change?

116
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:45,486
Or could it be
her massive stripper titties?!

117
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,455
There it is.

118
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,190
Boob-ya!

119
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,092
And that's when
Malakai the Squid came,

120
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:57,465
rips off his face,
and beneath it is my face.

121
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:59,667
I liked it.
Thank you, sir.

122
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,210
Yeah, of course he likes it.
Look at him.

123
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,471
Motherfucker got two heads
and three trunks.

124
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,681
All right,
we'll put a pin in it.

125
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,039
I'm gonna
go take a leak.

126
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,016
What the...?!

127
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:24,124
My hands are dry!
My hands are dry!

128
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:29,229
My name is
Risotto Groupon.

129
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,865
I am the assistant general
manager of the restaurant.

130
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,534
Do you have
any comment cards,

131
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,968
because I might have
some thoughts.

132
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,805
My kingdom was
usurped by force

133
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,139
with weapons
and technology

134
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,874
supplied by
your father-in-law!

135
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:43,243
Hey, he usurped
my kingdom, too, man.

136
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:46,046
He basically got me kicked out
of my home, stole my family.

137
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,315
Then we are brothers,
and you have wondered

138
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,584
what your life could have been
without Rick.

139
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:51,852
Wondered? Sure.

140
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,887
I mean, I've wondered
about having a vagina.

141
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,255
Would you help me
kill him?

142
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,590
What? No!

143
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:58,426
He's my wife's father.
Move on.

144
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,494
Do you...
like theme-park rides?

145
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:02,162
Oh, you really moved on.

146
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:06,233
There is a popular attraction
here called the Whirly Dirly.

147
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:09,002
Between the first whirly
and the third dirly,

148
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,105
the ride dips just outside
the immortality field.

149
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,274
You're asking me to lure Rick
to his death?

150
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,177
I'm only asking you
to go on a ride with Rick,

151
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,380
get off the ride without Rick,
and go home to your family,

152
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:22,716
where you can...
wonder about having a vagina.

153
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,618
Okay, okay, that was
a very specific example

154
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:25,919
pulled from thin air.

155
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:27,296
I don't want to be known
as the vagina guy.

156
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,723
Risotto, you're needed.
Someone ordered

157
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:32,059
the Nuzzy Guzzy Fresh
and Fluzzy Special.

158
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:34,795
Look, I'm not like Rick,

159
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:37,064
so you're free to do
as you please.

160
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,099
But there comes a time
in every man's life

161
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,068
when he must choose
the foundation

162
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,136
on which his legacy
will be built...

163
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,640
One of compromise
or one of blood.

164
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:53,180
♪ Once a time of year,
there's a special person here ♪

165
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,890
Oh, yeah.

166
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,092
That's what I'm talking about.

167
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:09,162
Oops! Okay, a little more
on the other side then.

168
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:10,498
Oh, come on!

169
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,399
Oh, geez!

170
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,067
Aah! Stop!

171
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,104
So, the hospital just let you
walk right out of there

172
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,506
with horse parts
in a bag?

173
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:19,673
For Christ's sakes,
Morty,

174
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:20,784
women going through
a divorce

175
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:21,942
need a creative outlet.

176
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,511
What was that?

177
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,147
Summer!

178
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:31,051
I'm coming, Summer!

179
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,187
What the hell
happened?!

180
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,326
How do we get her
back to normal?!

181
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,795
I don't know, man! This thing is
pretty complicated.

182
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,196
I-I'm gonna call Rick.

183
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,165
Well, hold on.
We can't just call your grandpa

184
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,634
whenever
there's a problem.

185
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,201
We can handle this
ourselves.

186
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:50,137
I mean, I don't see the point
in trying to.

187
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,039
This is obviously
Rick-level shit.

188
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:53,707
I have
a medical degree.

189
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:55,142
Is that
what this is about?

190
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,677
L-Like, you want
to prove yourself?

191
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,846
Oh, it's not about anything,
Morty. How dare you?

192
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,380
Okay, good.
Then I'll just call... Ow!

193
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,215
Morty, I need this.

194
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,394
Hey, Jerry, triple trunks here
says he knows a place

195
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,688
where the ladies drop panties
for anyone bi-pedal.

196
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:08,961
Yeah, I'm
not really interested.

197
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,724
My heart still belongs
to Beth.

198
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:12,225
Oh. Huh. Okay.

199
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,228
What, you don't think
I have a shot?

200
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:16,329
I didn't say that.

201
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,465
Excuse me.
May I have another one of these?

202
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,033
Coming
right up.

203
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:22,870
Hmm, things weren't always
so bad between Beth and me.

204
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,638
We had some good times
when we were younger.

205
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:26,039
Oh, yeah, I bet.

206
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:27,717
That's how teenage pregnancy
happens, my friend.

207
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,242
Yeah, no.

208
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:31,679
Things were pretty great, even
until a couple of years ago.

209
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,013
Jerry, I get it.

210
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,658
That's around the time
I moved in with you guys.

211
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:35,983
Oh, I guess
you're right.

212
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,527
Jerry, you know,
I hope you're not suggesting

213
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,428
that I had anything to do
with your marriage breaking up,

214
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,222
because there are some major
issues between you and Beth

215
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,224
that have been there
since you guys met.

216
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:48,696
Hey, to
new beginnings.

217
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,397
To the Whirly Dirly.

218
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,932
The Whirly Dirly?

219
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:54,434
All right,
what's going on here?

220
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,269
When did you get cool?!

221
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,839
When you stole my wife!

222
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,049
I should have done that
a long time ago!

223
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,842
We're going on
the Whirly Dirly!

224
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,410
Whirly Dirly, baby.

225
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:06,213
Aha, look at this.

226
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,581
It says "normalize."

227
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:09,049
I bet if we
just press that...

228
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,084
But... if the machine was made
by spider people,

229
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:12,920
normal would mean
eight legs.

230
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:14,888
Oh, God! Are you gonna
go on another spiel

231
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:16,790
like you did
with the flesh-colored crayon?

232
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:19,226
I'm pretty sure "normalize"
will make her normal.

233
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,930
Aah!

234
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:24,898
I'd call that progress.

235
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:26,399
She's huge!
And normal!

236
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,035
I'm not normal!

237
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,136
Mom!

238
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,313
Okay, this says "reverse."
Done and done.

239
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,072
I don't think
that's a good idea.

240
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,185
Oh, come on! What else
could "reverse" possibly mean?

241
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,710
Aah!

242
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:38,746
Mom, call Rick!

243
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,147
Thank you.

244
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,725
There's a customer-service
number on here.

245
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:42,950
Mom!

246
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,289
Oh, man.
This is gonna be awesome!

247
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,959
I got to hand it to you, Jerry.
This was a solid idea.

248
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:53,160
Uh, yeah.
Uh-huh.

249
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,162
And you know what?
I'll cop to it.

250
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,730
I put a lot of strain
on your marriage.

251
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:58,498
It wasn't fair.
I'm sorry.

252
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,433
What?! I didn't respect
your marriage.

253
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:01,969
I certainly
didn't do it any favors.

254
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:03,436
And for what it's worth,

255
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,605
I'll apologize to Beth for it
when we get home.

256
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,841
Whoo! Whirly Dirly! Yeah!

257
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,176
Stop the ride!
We got to get off.

258
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,644
What are you
talking about, buddy?

259
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:12,188
We got to get out of this thing.
We got to get out!

260
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:14,414
Jerry, come on, man!

261
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,959
We haven't even gotten
to the first whirly.

262
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:18,251
No, no, this sucks.
It's so boring.

263
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,820
I mean,
I'm falling asleep here.

264
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,573
Let's just get out and crawl
down the sides.

265
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,365
Uh, get down!
Duck down!

266
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,867
It's more fun
when you scrunch down.

267
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:35,969
Jerry, what the...

268
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:38,471
Oh shit!

269
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,389
Rick, up here! There's
a spot where you can kill him!

270
00:10:56,423 --> 00:11:00,127
Good call, Jerry!

271
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,661
Hey, how'd you know
about that?

272
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:02,996
Uh...

273
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,580
Lisa?

274
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:31,058
So, uh, Jerry, big fan
of the Whirly Dirly, are you?

275
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:33,226
Not anymore.
Obviously.

276
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,063
But when you were,
how did you know about it?

277
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:42,903
We had a deal,
Jerry Smith.

278
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,941
It's a really
common name.

279
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,044
Now, take it easy, Rick.

280
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,688
You've been in a serious
roller-coaster crash.

281
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,290
It's... It's no time
to be thinking about

282
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,784
who did or didn't play a role
in your attempted murder.

283
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,518
Get it off me!

284
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,853
It's eating me!

285
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,388
Look, I confess, okay?

286
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,032
They told me about all the
bad stuff you did to this planet

287
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,092
and reminded me of all
the bad stuff you did to me.

288
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,702
But then you said
you were sorry, and I realized

289
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,071
you're not a monster...
Not like this thing.

290
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,863
Fuck
It's got me good.

291
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,098
This is a mislead,
right?

292
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:12,900
You're inventing a thing
to save me.

293
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,310
That would be called
a knife, Jerry.

294
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:15,769
It's been invented.

295
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:17,646
I'm making a way out of here...
One seat ought to do it.

296
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,139
I'm sorry.
I-I made a mistake.

297
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,708
I won't do it again!
Nobody ever does.

298
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,779
You self-righteous
piece of shit.

299
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:27,380
You took my family!

300
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,782
I took your family?

301
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:30,326
Who do you think
had more taken from them

302
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,584
when you shot 20 ccs

303
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,453
of liquid dream-killer
into my daughter?

304
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,323
She was Rick's daughter, Jerry.
She had options!

305
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,724
Oof.

306
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,726
That all ended
because she felt sorry for you.

307
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,895
You act like prey,
but you're a predator!

308
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,596
You use pity to lure in
your victims!

309
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,932
That's how you survive!

310
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,275
I survive
because I know everything.

311
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,301
That snakes survives
because children wander off,

312
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:49,937
and you survive
because people think,

313
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,572
"Oh, this poor piece of shit.
He never gets a break."

314
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,441
I can't stand
the deafening silent wails

315
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:55,809
of his wilting soul.

316
00:12:55,843 --> 00:12:57,444
"I guess I'll hire him
or marry him."

317
00:12:57,477 --> 00:13:01,014
- Rick!
- Rick!

318
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,088
I knew you wouldn't
let me die.

319
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,489
That was never an option.

320
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,958
Because you never had
a son.

321
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:12,592
No, because I need
a living organism

322
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,462
coated in gibble snake bile
to attract a shmooglite runner.

323
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,530
Wait, what's happening? Use
that confusion, Jerry.

324
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:20,767
It'll make you wriggle more like
an abandoned newborn.

325
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,770
Jesus Christ!

326
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,773
What the fuck Rick?!

327
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,276
Help!
Help me!

328
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,079
Aaah!

329
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,956
There's a space port
20 miles south.

330
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,992
We'll be able to board
a galaxy class cruise ship

331
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,402
and jump through a wormhole
that will put us

332
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,962
within spitting distance
of the Milky Way.

333
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,363
But, hey,
it's about the journey,

334
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:52,465
not the destination,
right, Jerry?

335
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:58,571
Just stay put, sweetie!
Mom's still on hold.

336
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,640
Morphizer customer service.
How may I help you?

337
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,986
Yes, I'm having a little trouble
with one of your machines.

338
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,644
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that, ma'am.

339
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,480
Do you see a little compartment
on the side of the machine?

340
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,049
Let me check.
Yes, got it.

341
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,383
Mom?

342
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,986
Great! Now, do you see
the little button next to it?

343
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,888
I do. Give that button a push.

344
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:16,556
Okay.
Mom, listen to me!

345
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,858
We're free!!

346
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:21,728
Okay, so I pushed the button,
and three little men ran out.

347
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,596
What do I do next?

348
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,998
Hello?

349
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,166
I think
we got disconnected.

350
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,267
Morty!

351
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,435
Don't "Morty" me!

352
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,179
I tricked Rick into taking Dad
on an adventure

353
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,347
because I thought
I could get a break

354
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,940
from this kind of shit
but no!

355
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:35,175
Like father,
like Goddamn daughter!

356
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,377
You want to be like Rick,
congratulations!

357
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,513
You're just as arrogant
and just as irresponsible!

358
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,848
Everything
okay here?

359
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,450
Mind your own Goddamn
business, Gene!

360
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,286
I'm having a conversation
with my mother here!

361
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,431
Kissing Rick's ass isn't gonna
help him keep him around,

362
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:51,358
Mom, but it will help you lose
everyone else.

363
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,193
Like I lost Summer.

364
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,894
Hey, you haven't
lost her yet.

365
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,863
No, I definitely did.
She's gone.

366
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,531
God damn it!

367
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,935
Go ahead.

368
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,605
Oh, come on.
What's happening?

369
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,875
Your friend is class C or above
cybernetic augmentations.

370
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,377
Emphasis on the above.

371
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,921
In any case,
he needs to be neutralized.

372
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:13,213
What?! Wait!

373
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,247
Ugh!

374
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,283
Brain hurty.

375
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:17,550
What did you do?

376
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,595
It's a synaptic dampener
that blocks violent tendencies

377
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:20,920
and controversial thought.

378
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:23,056
He will now be
an ideal passenger.

379
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,292
I want cookies
and a 90-minute cut of "Avatar."

380
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:26,826
Seriously?

381
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,595
Quit it. It'll wear
off in six hours.

382
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:31,298
It's cheaper than banning
dangerous people from flights.

383
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,100
I mean, let everybody
buy a ticket, right?

384
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:34,901
Otherwise,
the terrorists win.

385
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,740
Aah!

386
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,310
I'm sorry I'm not
a classic maternal archetype.

387
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,188
Okay, I don't know what to do
when you people come to me

388
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:47,080
with your weird
puberty issues.

389
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,082
What are you gonna do
when your daughter asks you

390
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:50,183
if she's attractive?

391
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:52,452
I'll say "yes"!
Morty, gross!

392
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,087
Well, she's
gonna be super hot.

393
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,755
Her mother's gonna be
Jessica...

394
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,324
Wait, when did Summer
ask you that?!

395
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:59,759
Right before she Clive Barkered
herself. Why?

396
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,261
Wait,
I know where she is!

397
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,196
Ethan and Summer were
supposed to go camping,

398
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,432
and then he dumped Summer
for this girl, Tricia Lange,

399
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,600
who's got huge boobies
and took her.

400
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,778
Campsite... The one with the
name that sounds like somebody

401
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,804
gave up halfway
through naming it.

402
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,440
Uh... Camp Flabanabba!

403
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,008
Mama's coming, baby.

404
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:17,544
Mama's coming, and she cares
about your titties!

405
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,947
They have
sweet smiggle honey cookies.

406
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,017
Mmm! And low-calorie
petroleum flakes.

407
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:25,218
Obviously cookies.

408
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:26,453
Let's get you
the flakes then.

409
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,887
Okay, but it's not
what I wanted.

410
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,389
Well, maybe next time,
you won't be

411
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,791
such a dumb piece of shit
and you can pick for yourself.

412
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,126
That's not nice.
What's that?

413
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,028
Did you just have
a controversial thought?

414
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:36,696
No. That's what I
thought, bitch.

415
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,698
You little punk-ass.

416
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,467
This is the best.

417
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,835
I agree.
You've made things even easier

418
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,304
than if you hadn't
been incompetent.

419
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,306
Uh-oh.
We get shoot-shoot now.

420
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,419
All right, folks, if you
could please take your seats,

421
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,079
we're about to enter
the wormhole.

422
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:54,381
So, I hope everybody bought
a dinner first.

423
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:55,815
Nice.
Nice.

424
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,184
Jerry, step over there

425
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:58,651
and lock yourself
in the escape pod.

426
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,420
You're not killing us?
I'm killing Rick.

427
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:03,056
You're free to go. You're
no threat to me or anyone.

428
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,491
Now you're
just being mean.

429
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,059
Yeah, you're mean...
No offense.

430
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:07,727
Mean would be
shooting you, Jerry.

431
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,096
This is
saving a bullet.

432
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:10,730
Go back to
your quietly ashamed family

433
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,075
and live out
the rest of your days

434
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,733
in denial
of your vagina fantasies.

435
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,669
It was a one-time thought
that everyone has!

436
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,506
What are you doing?

437
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,741
I'm being
triumphantly brave!

438
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,343
It's not triumphant
or brave.

439
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,677
You're not risking
anything.

440
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:25,845
You might shoot me.

441
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,180
I think
you know I won't.

442
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,524
Because you know
I feel sorry for you.

443
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,059
You're just doing this
so you can tell yourself

444
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,451
you fought... Ow!

445
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,521
Temporal shield compromised.

446
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,124
Congratulations, Jerry.
You get to die a man.

447
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,591
Uh, that's okay!
I'll leave!

448
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,594
Please don't shoot.
I-I'm the vagina guy, remember?

449
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:49,769
Whoa!
What is happening to me?

450
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,771
Where is this?
Where am I?

451
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,140
Am I dead?

452
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:54,641
A-Am I... Am I still alive?

453
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:57,377
Those aren't the questions
you should be asking.

454
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,378
Huh?!

455
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,512
Shh!

456
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:24,103
Ah, got ya!

457
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,572
Come here,
you little pumpkin.

458
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,974
I have shit on my ass.

459
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,909
Whoa, oof this!

460
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,444
Who am I?

461
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:32,945
Who am I?

462
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:36,082
I'm time!
I'm literally time!

463
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:41,454
Whooooa!

464
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:42,789
Aah!

465
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:45,525
Oh, God. I feel like
our souls were united,

466
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,760
and we were all one
with eternity.

467
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,262
Our body's unchanged,

468
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,764
yet our minds have lived
a thousand lifetimes.

469
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,800
Is that enough time
for me to forgive you?

470
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,010
I don't know,
but it's enough time

471
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:57,003
for a synaptic dampener
to wear off.

472
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,510
He hadn't decided
he was still going to kill us!

473
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:05,612
He was talking himself into it.
I've seen it before.

474
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,448
Cosmic apotheosis wears off
faster than salvia.

475
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,559
I'm starting to believe you
because I just finished merging

476
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,519
with your essence
for an endless epoch,

477
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:14,621
and I'm already back to thinking
you're an asshole.

478
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,456
Fine with me.
Let's just go our separate ways.

479
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,024
Sounds like you
and the word "epoch"

480
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:19,235
have a lot
of catching up to do.

481
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,793
Wait, don't leave me!

482
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,338
All right, folks,
you're free to get up

483
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:23,830
and walk around the cabin

484
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,965
and maybe take the wormhole out
for breakfast.

485
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,743
Okay, you can do the dinner one
or the breakfast one,

486
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,269
but not both.

487
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,139
You think you got that thing
figured out?

488
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,341
Yeah, I know
what I'm doing.

489
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:36,343
Good.
Because I have an idea.

490
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:42,148
It's actually a contraction
of "some" and "more,"

491
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,583
you see that?
Oh, wow.

492
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:44,684
I was way off.

493
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,504
Morty,
what's happening here?

494
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,273
Summer got into
my grandpa's garage,

495
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,675
messed around, and
turned herself into a monster.

496
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,910
My mom did the same
to make her feel better.

497
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,211
She's a good mom.

498
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,284
Oh, my God.
I have to go call my mother!

499
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,018
Tricia, wait!
Ethan! Ethan!

500
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,020
Hey, it's okay.
Sit down.

501
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,356
You made
my sister cry, Ethan.

502
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,957
You messed with
her body image.

503
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:26,125
Look, Morty, I...

504
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,460
Shh, shh, shh.

505
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:30,730
Careful, Ethan.
Your s'more is burning.

506
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,942
Uh, I guess we better
get on the same page

507
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,377
about our fake adventure.

508
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:45,812
Right.
I'll make you a deal.

509
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,390
I'll leave out the part
where you tried to murder me...

510
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,815
And I'll leave out
the part

511
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:52,652
where you admitted
to sabotaging our marriage.

512
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:53,786
You want to...?

513
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,555
Nah, if the family
sees me like this,

514
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,223
they'll
feel sorry for me.

515
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,726
Which is no longer
my signature move.

516
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,794
Later days, amigo.

517
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,232
Actually, I just realized,
I don't have my wallet,

518
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,576
and my bus pass is in there,
so maybe...

519
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,235
Stay strong, Jerry.
I believe in you!

520
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:52,178
I tell you, fellas.
This is the life.

521
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:53,813
It certainly is.

522
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:55,014
To freedom!

523
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,385
Ooh!
Looks like a 4-22.

524
00:21:58,418 --> 00:21:59,886
Ooh, a couple cranks
on scaling knob

525
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,789
with a four dilabyte cross fade
would fix that in a jiff.

526
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,525
Four? You'd be lucky
to clear 13% de-morphized

527
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:06,959
with that
kind of range.

528
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:10,062
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
what did we agree on?

529
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:11,498
No work talk!

530
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:14,467
Let's just relax and enjoy
our retirement, shall...

531
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,135
Oh, my God!

532
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,770
Aaah!
