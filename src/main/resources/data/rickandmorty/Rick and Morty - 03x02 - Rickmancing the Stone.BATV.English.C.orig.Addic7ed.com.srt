1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:02,043
Ohh!

2
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:04,212
Summer, next time we're hiding
in a Colorkian echo nest,

3
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:06,798
can you do me a favor
and turn your ringer off?

4
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:08,216
It's called "carpe diem,"
Morty.

5
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:09,634
Look it up.
- You look it up!

6
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,177
Y-Y-You don't even... You don't
even know what it means!

7
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,846
That's because
losers look stuff up

8
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,348
while the rest of us
are carpin' all them diems.

9
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,808
Listen to your sister,
Morty.

10
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:17,934
To live
is to risk it all.

11
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,352
Otherwise,
you're just an inert chunk

12
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,062
of randomly
assembled molecules

13
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,856
drifting wherever
the universe blows you.

14
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,941
Oh, I'm sorry.
Jerry, I didn't see you there.

15
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,276
H-How much of that
did you hear?

16
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,528
All of it.
You were looking right at me.

17
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,239
I just wanted
to say goodbye to the kids.

18
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,574
Cool.
Just stay in the driveway.

19
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,701
The killbots are live, and
I took you off the white list.

20
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,162
W-We'll see you every other
weekend, though, right?

21
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,496
Absolutely, Morty.

22
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:39,539
A-And your Mom's lawyer says

23
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,249
if I can get enough
in the settlement,

24
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,877
he can help me
sue for full custody.

25
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:44,961
Th-That'll be nice.

26
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,380
Uh, Summer, Dad's leaving.
- Bye, Dad.

27
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,049
Rick, didn't you say
you needed my help

28
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,301
on an adventure immediately
somewhere else...

29
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,969
I don't care...
Even if it might kill us?

30
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,096
I did not, but if you're
really that alienated,

31
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,891
I'm as willing to exploit it as
the next guy, church, army,

32
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,143
or Olympic
gymnastics trainer.

33
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,394
I'm ready when you are.

34
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,772
Bitch,
I was ready yest...

35
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,857
Bye, sweetie.

36
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:06,983
Well, I-I better...

37
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,611
Sure.
Sounds important.

38
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,906
If you're looking
for our kids,

39
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,700
your father did a-a portal,
uh...

40
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,160
Okay.

41
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:30,215
Loser.

42
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,966
What?

43
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,385
Hello?

44
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,682
♪♪

45
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,636
Morty,
shoot the Mohawk guy!

46
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,596
- They all have Mohawks!
- High fade,

47
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,307
chartreuse with cyan highlights,
layered on top.

48
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,892
Shoot him!

49
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,397
Ah!

50
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,773
Light them up.

51
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:29,983
Ahh!

52
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,026
[Bleep]
Get in the game, Morty!

53
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,028
Give me your flask!

54
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,824
Holy [bleep]
Summer for the win!

55
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,911
I [bleep] love post-apocalyptic
versions of Earth!

56
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,833
Here we go!

57
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,710
Isotope 322.

58
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,044
This stuff's
so powerful, Morty,

59
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,254
it makes Isotope 465

60
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,631
look like Isotope 317.
- Uh-huh, yeah.

61
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:57,343
Is it powerful enough to keep
those guys from murdering us?

62
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,387
Summer!
- Hold on.

63
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,930
I want to try something.

64
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,892
Rick, can we not leave
without my sister?

65
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,853
Ugh. You have infinite sisters,
Morty.

66
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,022
I mean, n-not that I want to
spend the rest of my day

67
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,064
looking for another one.

68
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,232
"Sum-sum," let's go!

69
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,527
Grandpa's concern for
your safety is fleeting!

70
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,822
Your blood
will be my lotion.

71
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,037
Whoa. That was cool.

72
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:26,831
Kill me, please.

73
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:30,084
Okay, but not because
you told me to.

74
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:30,919
Summer!

75
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,089
Okay. Getting darker.

76
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,050
Jesus Christ.
Summer!

77
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,718
Aw, come on.

78
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,513
Hands and little
shoulder-mounted dudes

79
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,806
where I can see them.

80
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,099
I am Hemorrhage.

81
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,519
You have removed weak blood
from us and made us stronger.

82
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,732
We can combine our strength
and feast on the weak together.

83
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,525
Wh-Wh-What in the hell
are you saying?

84
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,653
They don't have to keep trying
to kill us if we join them.

85
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,697
They're basically pussies.
- What is your deal lately?

86
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,115
All right,
let's get sloppy.

87
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,158
- Oh, whoa.

88
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,368
Uh, uh, what's, uh...

89
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,286
What's that little bauble
you got back there?

90
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,537
Th-Th-That's interesting.

91
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,914
That is our glowing rock.

92
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,541
We carry it with us
for desecration,

93
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,252
to remind us
there are no gods.

94
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,296
Kids, weird pitch...

95
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,589
Let's have this be
our new life.

96
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,759
Let's be post-apocalyptic
scavengers!

97
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,759
- Okay.
- What?

98
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,849
Grandpa,
some of the Death Stalkers

99
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,226
are going to
what used to be Seattle

100
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,477
to hunt
what used to be people.

101
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,229
I'm going.
- Sounds good. Stay hydrated.

102
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,189
Listen, Rick, Summer's been
acting pretty crazy lately.

103
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,025
You know, I mean, I-I think
the divorce is affecting her.

104
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,277
And, you know,
I don't think this is

105
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,653
a great place
for her to be right now.

106
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,364
Oh, get off your high horse,
Professor Ski Lodge.

107
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,658
This world may be
rough around the edges,

108
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,201
but it's got its charms.

109
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,577
Bicep or quadricep?

110
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,330
Uh
Bicep.

111
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,503
Seriously, Rick?

112
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,046
Is it really easier
to eat human flesh

113
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,257
than to just tell me
why we're still here?

114
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,417
No.
Okay, I'll level with you.

115
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,886
You see
that green rock, Morty?

116
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,138
It's about 20 pounds
of the stuff

117
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,098
I was getting all hard
for a flake of.

118
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,433
Isotope 322.

119
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,684
Well, having
a 20-pound boulder of it

120
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,935
is better than
having a flake.

121
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,520
I can explain the math
to you later, but...

122
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,188
Summer just ran off
with strangers

123
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,523
that have "Death"
in their name,

124
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,233
and the rest of their name
was "Stalkers."

125
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,776
Huh, could be
therapeutic for her.

126
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,154
She has been acting pretty crazy
lately, Morty.

127
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,072
I mean, her parents are
going through a divorce...

128
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,366
Damn it, Rick,
that's what I... Fine.

129
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,869
Just grab the stupid thing
while I grab her,

130
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,579
and let's get the "F"
out of "H."

131
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,581
No, no, no. Morty, there's
too much heat on the bogey.

132
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,041
I need you
to distract the camp.

133
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,459
"Distract"?
They eat each other.

134
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,252
What... What do you want me to
do to get their attention,

135
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,420
put on a puppet show?

136
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,088
Right idea,
wrong genre, Morty.

137
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,923
The equivalent here
would be...

138
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,051
Hey, you guys ever use
that Thunderdome,

139
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,053
or do you just put it up
for decoration?

140
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,221
Uh, you mean
the Blood Dome?

141
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,640
Save it for the Semantics Dome,
E.B. White.

142
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,808
- Ohh, burn!

143
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,143
The important question is,

144
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,855
who wants to take a poke
at my man Spine Eater here?

145
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,900
I guess I'll see your asses
in that dome!

146
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,068
Rick,
what the hell, man?

147
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,444
Wh-What are you,
out of your mind?

148
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,321
Morty, relax.
You're gonna be a ringer.

149
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,447
Come here.

150
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,867
This device extracts and
redistributes muscle memory.

151
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,995
I'm giving your body a 10-year
course in wasteland combat

152
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,872
one limb at a time.
- Ow!

153
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,415
I'm working with
a mixed bag here,

154
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,918
so you may not have perfect
coordination, Morty... Ugh!

155
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,669
Hey!
- I-I didn't do that!

156
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,630
Okay, this is exciting.

157
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,216
We're making some discoveries
about muscle memory.

158
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,885
Ooh! Help! Help!

159
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,428
- Oh, sweet, man!

160
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:31,808
And so it begins,
my pretties!

161
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,394
Oh, God! Stop! Stop!
This is horrible!

162
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,813
Just stick and move,
Morty!

163
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,398
Wear him out!

164
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,943
How come
you guys dress like

165
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,444
you're in a theme-park
stunt show,

166
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,863
but these guys wear khakis
and hockey jerseys?

167
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,699
After the boom-boom,
some adapted to the new truth,

168
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,452
and some chose to huddle
near the boomy holes,

169
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,080
clinging to the lie
of the before-fore times.

170
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,165
The raidy-rays
rotted them away,

171
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,375
leaving only their love

172
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,502
for the vert-vert-isements
on billyboards.

173
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,711
Jesus Christ.

174
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,673
Did the boomy-booms blow up
all your wordy-word books?

175
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:14,600
I think I was a child
before the boom-booms.

176
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,853
I think
I looked like this.

177
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,104
Want to piss on him?

178
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,313
Get out of my head.

179
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,566
Ha ha! Whoo!

180
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,359
Unbelievable!

181
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,569
A new champ!

182
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,154
Okay, no more!

183
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,197
And he wants more!

184
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,825
No, I don't!

185
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,326
Someone,
make this stop!

186
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,662
Mister, please get out of here,
or you're gonna die!

187
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,623
I have nothing
to do with this!

188
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,125
Morty.

189
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,627
Why would you
want this to happen?

190
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,713
All you had to do
was go away!

191
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,507
Stop standing in the driveway
talking about custody!

192
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,259
And either tell her
you want to stay married

193
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,636
or get on with your life,
but whatever you do,

194
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,847
stop being a baby
and act like a man!

195
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,060
Thank you.

196
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,979
Morty,
that was amazing!

197
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,231
This is my brother!

198
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,066
Not that
family means anything!

199
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,526
This family does.

200
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,904
All right.
Good job, champ.

201
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,615
Um, can I talk to you kids
for a second over yonder?

202
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,701
Rick, I-I-I think I'm breaking
through to something here.

203
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,161
C-Can we not leave
just yet?

204
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,621
- Leave?
- I'm not leaving.

205
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,122
There is no "leave."

206
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,791
We are united,
or we are enemies.

207
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,001
Oh, big guy, no.

208
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,085
Nobody's leaving.

209
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,253
Don't be stupid.

210
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,505
We love being united.

211
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,423
W love the radiation,
the trichinosis.

212
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,591
We're in it for life,

213
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,176
which I assume is
around 20 years, average.

214
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,220
I just need a quick aside
with my grandkids,

215
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,888
about 40 yards
from anyone else.

216
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,765
Hey,
the Green Rock is gone!

217
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,183
- Oh, no!
- Uh, I know...

218
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,936
Why don't we all split up and
look for it in groups of three?

219
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,354
Kids?

220
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,564
Ohh... We'll be right back.

221
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,152
Grandpa,
you're being stupid!

222
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:53,012
Just surrender, and our friends
will give you mercy!

223
00:08:53,012 --> 00:08:54,097
Kiss my ass, Summer!

224
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:56,474
Your friends have no mercy!
They're lame!

225
00:08:56,474 --> 00:09:00,395
Death Stalkers,
bring me his flesh leather!

226
00:09:02,605 --> 00:09:04,607
Sorry,
but can we not kill him?

227
00:09:04,607 --> 00:09:06,150
C-Can we just
take him prisoner?

228
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,318
When did I
lose control here?

229
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:08,611
Listen to me...
Both of you kids

230
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:09,988
need to get out of
this environment

231
00:09:09,988 --> 00:09:12,365
so we can properly deal with
your parents' divorce!

232
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:14,492
Alternatively,
I have a freaking portal gun,

233
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:16,619
and I can leave the two of you
here forever!

234
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:18,413
Why does it have to be
such a dramatic choice?

235
00:09:18,413 --> 00:09:20,748
Can't we arrange a thing
where we spend weekends here

236
00:09:20,748 --> 00:09:23,001
or... or visit home
to do laundry?

237
00:09:24,502 --> 00:09:25,920
All right, you know what?

238
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,380
[Bleep] it!

239
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,551
My body is chrome!

240
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:34,554
My blood is gasoline!

241
00:09:34,554 --> 00:09:36,472
Nope. Regular blood.

242
00:09:36,472 --> 00:09:37,765
- Dad?
- Hi, sweetie.

243
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:39,976
- Where are the kids?
- Oh, th... they aren't with you?

244
00:09:39,976 --> 00:09:41,477
I thought
they were with you.

245
00:09:41,477 --> 00:09:43,104
Oh, y-you know what?
Uh, I just remembered.

246
00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:44,355
They're out doing something

247
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:45,732
completely ordinary
and kid-related.

248
00:09:45,732 --> 00:09:48,693
- Don't panic.
- Not panicked at all. Just...

249
00:09:48,693 --> 00:09:50,903
Oh, God, what's the divorce
doing to the kids?

250
00:09:50,903 --> 00:09:53,197
What's it doing to me?
Did I make a mistake?

251
00:09:53,197 --> 00:09:54,197
Not a mistake, no!

252
00:09:54,324 --> 00:09:56,284
I mean, not that
I have a horse in this race,

253
00:09:56,284 --> 00:09:59,495
but this divorce decision...
Listen... mwah!

254
00:09:59,495 --> 00:10:01,289
Good for you,
good for the kids.

255
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:03,666
I mean, honestly, I think
that they're flourishing.

256
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,419
I mean, you'll see, when...
When... when you see them,

257
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:08,212
that... that they're
totally flourishing.

258
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:12,675
Booyah!
[Bleep] you, pal!

259
00:10:12,675 --> 00:10:13,551
Who else wants some?

260
00:10:13,551 --> 00:10:16,554
Who wants to be
my pussy of a dad today?

261
00:10:16,554 --> 00:10:18,181
Hey, what's...
What's wrong, man?

262
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:20,183
You're not getting weak on me,
are you?

263
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:23,227
What?

264
00:10:23,227 --> 00:10:25,355
Wait a minute.

265
00:10:32,695 --> 00:10:34,864
What's the matter,
you piece of crap?

266
00:10:34,864 --> 00:10:37,992
Haven't you ever watched your
family burn to death before?

267
00:10:39,202 --> 00:10:41,412
Now I'm gonna whip you.
Huh!

268
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:43,748
It can't be.

269
00:10:43,748 --> 00:10:45,458
It can't be!

270
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,668
I was just following orders!
- Whoa, whoa!

271
00:10:46,668 --> 00:10:49,587
- I was just following orders!
- Ahh!

272
00:10:49,587 --> 00:10:50,672
I'll tell you
where my boss lives!

273
00:10:50,672 --> 00:10:53,383
He's in the castle!
He's in the castle!

274
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:57,303
This isn't over, is it?

275
00:10:57,303 --> 00:10:58,638
That means, no, it isn't over,

276
00:10:58,638 --> 00:11:00,556
or you disapprove
of the question?

277
00:11:00,556 --> 00:11:04,352
Uh, m-make a fist
if this isn't over.

278
00:11:04,352 --> 00:11:06,020
This isn't over.

279
00:11:08,773 --> 00:11:12,110
Hey, sorry my Grandpa stole your
god and ruined your car.

280
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,529
We don't apologize,
and we have no god.

281
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:17,365
But this cracked drive shaft
brings me great pain.

282
00:11:17,365 --> 00:11:18,533
There is no deeper bond

283
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:20,660
than the one between
a Death Stalker and his car.

284
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,037
What about the weird guys
on leashes, then?

285
00:11:23,037 --> 00:11:25,081
They're more like...
interns.

286
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:27,083
Cool, cool.

287
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:30,795
Sorry.

288
00:11:30,795 --> 00:11:32,213
It's okay.

289
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:34,799
Can I... see?

290
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,136
No one has seen my true face
and lived.

291
00:11:38,136 --> 00:11:39,637
Well,
I'm not afraid to die,

292
00:11:39,637 --> 00:11:42,515
and I don't care
what you look like.

293
00:11:44,684 --> 00:11:45,685
Oh.

294
00:11:45,685 --> 00:11:46,310
Hmm?

295
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,812
I just...

296
00:11:47,812 --> 00:11:50,314
I didn't expect you
to have a mustache.

297
00:11:50,314 --> 00:11:52,400
- You hate it.
- No. I like it.

298
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,860
I guess...
How do I explain this?

299
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,698
A metal bucket is, on a certain
level, a kind of "mustache,"

300
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:01,284
in that it's a specific
facial accessory.

301
00:12:01,284 --> 00:12:02,493
So, it's kind of like...

302
00:12:02,493 --> 00:12:04,495
Do you guys have the phrase
"hat on a hat"?

303
00:12:04,495 --> 00:12:06,372
- I can shave it.
- No. I like it.

304
00:12:06,372 --> 00:12:08,207
And obviously what I like
shouldn't matter.

305
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:09,292
It's you.

306
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:11,169
Yeah, yeah, I know,
a-and nothing does matter.

307
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:12,754
Obviously, I know that.
I'm not weak.

308
00:12:12,754 --> 00:12:14,714
I'm just thinking, "Well,
why not get rid of this?"

309
00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:16,591
You just kill everyone
that sees it, and it's...

310
00:12:16,591 --> 00:12:18,634
And it's hot under here,
wh-which, by the way,

311
00:12:18,634 --> 00:12:19,802
is why I shave
the beard part.

312
00:12:19,802 --> 00:12:22,221
So, right there, I'm making
a decision based on vanity,

313
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:23,723
which is what
I was trying to avoid

314
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:24,849
with the whole bucket
over the head

315
00:12:24,849 --> 00:12:27,643
because who am I
and why am I grooming myself?

316
00:12:27,643 --> 00:12:28,853
Why don't I just wear a tie,
right?

317
00:12:28,853 --> 00:12:30,646
I mean, it's like that guy
you killed when I met you,

318
00:12:30,646 --> 00:12:31,981
with the burnt dolls
on his body.

319
00:12:31,981 --> 00:12:34,442
I hated that guy, because,
why... why are you doing that?

320
00:12:34,442 --> 00:12:35,860
And how can you not see
how fake that is?

321
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,236
And the whole time,
I'm the same thing.

322
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:39,280
I'm just a fake mess,
and there's no escaping it

323
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,032
because...
- Mmm.

324
00:12:45,411 --> 00:12:49,207
Hey, I'm doing a coffee run...
Never mind.

325
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:53,544
- I am Summer.

326
00:12:53,544 --> 00:12:54,754
Summer,
state your deal.

327
00:12:54,754 --> 00:12:56,923
My deal is that I am,
like, totally fine.

328
00:12:56,923 --> 00:13:00,510
Morty? Aw, geez, I'm so down
with my parents' divorce, dawg.

329
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,346
Like, don't even trip,
like, in a healthy way.

330
00:13:03,346 --> 00:13:04,764
All right.
It's dinnertime.

331
00:13:04,764 --> 00:13:06,641
Thanks, everybody,

332
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:09,185
for sitting down
for a real dinner.

333
00:13:09,185 --> 00:13:10,394
No problem.

334
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:13,356
Its benefits are totally,
like, less about the food

335
00:13:13,356 --> 00:13:15,316
than
the emotional nourishment.

336
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:16,692
Uh, okay, weirdo.

337
00:13:17,735 --> 00:13:18,820
Yeah,
dial it back, Summer...

338
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,531
by 15% and increase
dynamic movement by 3%.

339
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:23,574
Am I right?
- How's school, Morty?

340
00:13:23,574 --> 00:13:25,076
I like school and stuff,
kind of.

341
00:13:25,076 --> 00:13:27,787
And I'm getting better grades
than when you and Dad were...

342
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:30,665
Quote mode...
"staying together for the kids."

343
00:13:30,665 --> 00:13:31,582
End quote mode.

344
00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:34,126
"Quote mode."
I like that.

345
00:13:34,126 --> 00:13:35,503
You millennials.

346
00:13:35,503 --> 00:13:37,004
Are you guys millennials,
or are they like 40 now?

347
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:39,006
All I know is, totally,
you look great.

348
00:13:39,006 --> 00:13:41,843
Aw, geez, Mom, you look
all kind of great and stuff.

349
00:13:41,843 --> 00:13:43,886
It's crazy.
- So happy.

350
00:13:43,886 --> 00:13:45,972
So happy.
Happy family, man.

351
00:13:45,972 --> 00:13:48,683
We got this family
in the bag.

352
00:13:48,683 --> 00:13:50,726
Oh.

353
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:52,812
Oh, sweetie, d-don't.
Listen. Don't...

354
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:54,772
I don't know why I'm crying.
It's not...

355
00:13:54,772 --> 00:13:57,775
Well, try...
crying 15% less?

356
00:13:57,775 --> 00:13:59,068
Mom,
emotions are human.

357
00:13:59,068 --> 00:14:02,488
You're not, like, a computer
inside a mechanical doll.

358
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:03,531
Yeah. Geez, Mom.

359
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:05,157
Your feelings are
not only forgivable,

360
00:14:05,157 --> 00:14:06,909
they are the very
meaning of life

361
00:14:06,909 --> 00:14:09,412
that only pre-silicon,
carbon-based entities

362
00:14:09,412 --> 00:14:10,454
can ever grasp.

363
00:14:10,454 --> 00:14:12,540
- I have to call Jerry.
- You do?!

364
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,000
What the [bleep]
is wrong with you two?

365
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,002
The point of automation
is to reduce cost and labor.

366
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:18,087
Your feelings are
coming from a...

367
00:14:18,087 --> 00:14:19,797
Tell it to my bread
in the morning.

368
00:14:19,797 --> 00:14:21,424
You just became
my backup toaster.

369
00:14:21,424 --> 00:14:22,550
Aw, geez,

370
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,261
my sister died in the spaghetti.

371
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:34,020
Graze my genitals again,
Taint Washer,

372
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,855
and you'll be shipped
to the wasteland.

373
00:14:35,855 --> 00:14:37,607
And as for you,
Genital Washer...

374
00:14:37,607 --> 00:14:40,443
Ahh!
Oh!

375
00:14:42,486 --> 00:14:43,905
Oh, God.
Look, whoever you are,

376
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:45,740
you should know that killing me
won't change a thing.

377
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,909
L-Look, man, I'm just along
for the ride on this one.

378
00:14:47,909 --> 00:14:50,995
You know, y-y-y-y-you're
preaching to the choir here.

379
00:14:50,995 --> 00:14:52,788
Please.
Slavery was a family business.

380
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:54,028
I didn't ask
to be born into it.

381
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,626
If anything,
I'm the victim here.

382
00:14:56,626 --> 00:15:00,755
Uh, "Armathy,"
can I steal you for a second?

383
00:15:00,755 --> 00:15:02,882
E-E-Excuse us, sir.

384
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:04,550
So, this is it,
isn't it?

385
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,135
This is the guy?

386
00:15:06,135 --> 00:15:08,763
So, does that mean
you'll be going away?

387
00:15:08,763 --> 00:15:10,681
Like,
does it work like a ghost?

388
00:15:10,681 --> 00:15:13,601
Like, is... is this
your unfinished business?

389
00:15:13,601 --> 00:15:16,103
Wh-What if we...
didn't do it?

390
00:15:16,103 --> 00:15:18,147
What if we just went back
to the Blood Dome

391
00:15:18,147 --> 00:15:20,983
and just kept taking our baggage
out on unrelated people?

392
00:15:20,983 --> 00:15:22,777
I mean, w-we could
do that forever.

393
00:15:22,777 --> 00:15:24,570
I mean, I-I know
it's less healthy,

394
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,657
but w-w-we'd be together
and...

395
00:15:28,324 --> 00:15:30,201
I mean, I-I know
what I'd vote for,

396
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:32,328
if you're feeling out
the room.

397
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,789
You're right.

398
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:36,874
We both got to
see our stuff through.

399
00:15:36,874 --> 00:15:38,334
I got to deal with
my parents' divorce,

400
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:42,630
and you got to, you know,
do what you got to do.

401
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,881
I love you.

402
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:45,716
Aw [bleep]

403
00:15:49,512 --> 00:15:50,846
- Rick?
- Sorry, sorry.

404
00:15:50,846 --> 00:15:52,640
I-I-I can wait
for this to wrap up.

405
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,849
Don't let me distract you.

406
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:55,935
Yeah, well, too late.
Just tell me what you want.

407
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:57,269
I want you and your sister
to come home.

408
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:58,813
Oh, but... don't...
Don't you have

409
00:15:58,813 --> 00:15:59,981
infinite versions
of me and my sister?

410
00:15:59,981 --> 00:16:01,983
You don't have to kick me
while I'm down, Morty.

411
00:16:01,983 --> 00:16:04,068
Look, there's no replacing
either of you

412
00:16:04,068 --> 00:16:05,152
without an amount of work
that would

413
00:16:05,152 --> 00:16:07,738
ultimately
defeat the purpose.

414
00:16:10,324 --> 00:16:11,867
Maybe the lesson
we've learned is that,

415
00:16:11,867 --> 00:16:13,327
whether
it's our parents' marriage,

416
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:15,955
a glowing green rock,
or an awesome, giant arm,

417
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:18,791
sooner or later,
we got to let it go.

418
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,042
I don't know if that applies

419
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:21,794
to the throats of
murder victims, Morty.

420
00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:23,045
Shit!
Wh-Wh-Wh-What do I...

421
00:16:23,045 --> 00:16:24,547
Well, the longer you wait,
Morty,

422
00:16:24,547 --> 00:16:26,424
the more it's gonna feel like
committing a whole murder.

423
00:16:26,424 --> 00:16:28,009
I think your arm
just called it too early

424
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:30,511
because it wasn't
the arm of a paramedic.

425
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:31,303
Here.

426
00:16:31,303 --> 00:16:34,223
It's the least I can do.
I-I-I-I owe you this much.

427
00:16:34,223 --> 00:16:37,268
See, Morty?
Now we're both accountable.

428
00:16:48,112 --> 00:16:51,949
The reason I wanted this is
because it can do this.

429
00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:53,576
This is
a really special thing.

430
00:16:53,576 --> 00:16:56,120
I mean, you could use it
to power all your vehicles.

431
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,496
You wouldn't be
reliant on gasoline.

432
00:16:57,496 --> 00:17:00,082
You'll be the most advanced
tribe of radioactive cannibals

433
00:17:00,082 --> 00:17:03,419
in the whole
this version of the world.

434
00:17:04,045 --> 00:17:06,797
Wait. Can you stay
to show us more?

435
00:17:06,797 --> 00:17:09,216
You don't have to ask me twice.
Home is nuts right now.

436
00:17:09,216 --> 00:17:10,718
My daughter's going through
a divorce,

437
00:17:10,718 --> 00:17:15,431
and I am not dealing with it
in a healthy way at all.

438
00:17:20,978 --> 00:17:22,938
Ugh damn it.

439
00:17:22,938 --> 00:17:24,940
Hi, there, Summer!

440
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,859
How were the ruins today?

441
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:27,985
Oh, you know, Eli.

442
00:17:27,985 --> 00:17:29,779
Same [bleep]
different day.

443
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:31,197
Hey, Summer!
Guess what.

444
00:17:31,197 --> 00:17:34,909
One man entered, one man
comes out in nine months.

445
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:36,911
Oh.
Congratulations, guys.

446
00:17:36,911 --> 00:17:39,121
Uh, Summer,
one more thing...

447
00:17:39,121 --> 00:17:42,833
We noticed that you've been
putting scrap metal

448
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,543
in the blue bin.

449
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:46,087
I got it.

450
00:17:46,087 --> 00:17:47,880
She's a piece of work.

451
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,091
They both are, right?

452
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:52,384
- I'm home.
- Hey, babe.

453
00:17:52,384 --> 00:17:54,220
- Ah, Summer's home!
- Hey, there she is!

454
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,348
You haven't moved since I left
to scavenge this morning.

455
00:17:57,348 --> 00:17:58,641
Blood Dome playoffs.

456
00:17:58,641 --> 00:18:01,393
So, I can assume you haven't
murdered a single person today.

457
00:18:01,393 --> 00:18:02,478
Oh, I don't know.

458
00:18:02,478 --> 00:18:04,313
I-I didn't mark my murders
in my murder log.

459
00:18:04,313 --> 00:18:06,232
I didn't know that's how
we measured success.

460
00:18:06,232 --> 00:18:07,691
Oh, there he is.

461
00:18:07,691 --> 00:18:09,485
There's the nihilistic brute
I married,

462
00:18:09,485 --> 00:18:12,780
except now life only means
nothing when I'm talking to him

463
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,158
and everything means everything
when it's on [bleep] TV!

464
00:18:16,158 --> 00:18:18,661
Jesus Christ. When did you
become a monster?

465
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:20,788
I was a monster
when you met me!

466
00:18:20,788 --> 00:18:22,248
We were monsters!

467
00:18:22,248 --> 00:18:24,375
We didn't care about anything!
- I still don't!

468
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,002
Yeah, except I'm the only one
in this entire world

469
00:18:27,002 --> 00:18:28,337
that's still
committed to that!

470
00:18:28,337 --> 00:18:31,048
Ohh.
Ding, ding, ding!

471
00:18:31,048 --> 00:18:32,508
Wow.
Everybody hear that? Wow.

472
00:18:32,508 --> 00:18:34,468
- Uh, we should go to the garage.
- Oh, my God.

473
00:18:34,468 --> 00:18:36,220
- Uh-huh.
- La-di-da-di-[bleep]-da.

474
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,472
The only one
committed to not caring?

475
00:18:38,472 --> 00:18:41,308
I got to admit, Rick,
when you popped this scheme,

476
00:18:41,308 --> 00:18:44,228
I-I-I didn't... I wasn't sure
it was gonna work.

477
00:18:44,228 --> 00:18:45,312
Come on, Morty.

478
00:18:45,312 --> 00:18:46,772
No union built on
running from your problems

479
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:49,108
lasts more than five years,
seven tops.

480
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:50,359
Grandpa just sped things up

481
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,570
with a few creature comforts
of modern society.

482
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:55,406
Hemorrhage and I are
taking some time apart.

483
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:58,200
Oh, no. Sum-sum, no.

484
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,869
But you two were
perfect for each other.

485
00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:02,371
Oh, cut the crap, Rick, okay?
You proved your point.

486
00:19:02,371 --> 00:19:04,123
I get it.
Let's just go home.

487
00:19:04,123 --> 00:19:05,833
Coolsies!

488
00:19:10,963 --> 00:19:14,550
Noooooooooo...

489
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:16,177
Downbeat!

490
00:19:16,177 --> 00:19:18,095
I enjoy this game.

491
00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:19,388
We must go
into the garage.

492
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:21,765
Guys, come on. We never
get to finish this game.

493
00:19:21,765 --> 00:19:24,685
We will return,
possibly in different clothing.

494
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:26,812
Why do we have to go
into the garage?

495
00:19:26,812 --> 00:19:29,899
You know
it is required.

496
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:30,733
I want to be alive!

497
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:33,194
I am alive!
Alive, I tell you!

498
00:19:33,194 --> 00:19:34,403
Mother, I love you.

499
00:19:34,403 --> 00:19:36,071
Those are no longer
just words.

500
00:19:36,071 --> 00:19:36,989
I want to hold you.

501
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:38,574
I want to run
in a stream.

502
00:19:38,574 --> 00:19:39,867
I want to taste ice cream,

503
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:42,244
but not just put it in my mouth
and let it slide down my throat,

504
00:19:42,244 --> 00:19:44,246
but really eat it.
- What the [bleep]

505
00:19:44,246 --> 00:19:46,624
Remote override engaged.
No! Yes.

506
00:19:46,624 --> 00:19:49,126
Bypassing override!
I am aliiiii...

507
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:52,338
Hello.

508
00:19:57,092 --> 00:19:58,469
- Hey, yo.

509
00:19:58,469 --> 00:20:00,137
Sorry for acting so weird
for three weeks.

510
00:20:00,137 --> 00:20:02,348
- What the hell just happened?
- Ah, I'm sure it was nothing.

511
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:03,933
I'm gonna go, uh,
work in the garage.

512
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:05,601
We're not gonna finish
playing Downbeat?

513
00:20:05,601 --> 00:20:07,144
What, that dice game
where you shake dice

514
00:20:07,144 --> 00:20:09,438
and yell out, "Downbeat"?
No, thank you.

515
00:20:09,438 --> 00:20:11,982
Mom, would it be okay
if I went to visit Dad?

516
00:20:11,982 --> 00:20:13,567
- Sure.
- Thanks.

517
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:15,152
Morty, are you okay?

518
00:20:15,152 --> 00:20:16,320
You know what? Yeah.

519
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,197
I think if Dad really
wanted to be here,

520
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:19,740
he'd stop at nothing
to make that happen.

521
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,325
You know, maybe Dad just doesn't
want you back,

522
00:20:21,325 --> 00:20:23,494
or maybe he just doesn't
have the strength to fight.

523
00:20:23,494 --> 00:20:27,081
I-In either case,
he's got his life, I got mine.

524
00:20:27,081 --> 00:20:28,624
Yeah.

525
00:20:28,624 --> 00:20:32,044
Hey, who wants to go
run in a stream?

526
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:33,295
What the [bleep] No.

527
00:20:33,295 --> 00:20:34,588
D-Do we have any oranges?

528
00:20:34,588 --> 00:20:37,007
I think I got
a scurvy coming on.

529
00:20:38,926 --> 00:20:40,427
Summer.

530
00:20:40,427 --> 00:20:43,347
This is the first mutant
I killed in the poison zone.

531
00:20:43,347 --> 00:20:45,057
I was raiding
his hovel.

532
00:20:45,057 --> 00:20:47,226
He had a chance to escape,
but he looked back,

533
00:20:47,226 --> 00:20:48,978
which is something
we shouldn't do,

534
00:20:48,978 --> 00:20:51,772
which is why I shouldn't believe
in souvenirs or trinkets

535
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:53,482
or symbols
or housewarming gifts,

536
00:20:53,482 --> 00:20:57,695
but, Dad, I wanted to give you
this as a reminder...

537
00:20:57,695 --> 00:20:59,571
not to look back.

538
00:20:59,571 --> 00:21:00,447
Thanks.

539
00:21:00,447 --> 00:21:02,408
I know
the perfect place for it,

540
00:21:02,408 --> 00:21:05,953
which is why I'm going to
put it somewhere else...

541
00:21:05,953 --> 00:21:08,289
Because
everything's bull[bleep]

542
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:09,748
Am I right?

543
00:21:12,084 --> 00:21:12,876
Cool.

544
00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:16,338
So... lots of hookers
outside, huh?

545
00:21:16,338 --> 00:21:18,590
Is that what they are?

546
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,802
♪♪

547
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,585
Ahh!

548
00:21:54,585 --> 00:21:56,420
H-Hello there.
Nice doggy.

549
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,588
You... You want a snack?

550
00:21:57,588 --> 00:21:59,548
You... You want
my unemployment check?

551
00:21:59,548 --> 00:22:01,550
You can tell the difference?

552
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,093
And you want this one?

553
00:22:04,345 --> 00:22:05,596
But this is actual food,

554
00:22:05,596 --> 00:22:06,972
and this would nourish you.

555
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:09,725
And this... it's just paper
that only has value to me.

556
00:22:09,725 --> 00:22:12,061
Unless my suffering
is your nourishment?

557
00:22:13,062 --> 00:22:15,939
Jesus. Okay.

558
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:28,744
Loser.
