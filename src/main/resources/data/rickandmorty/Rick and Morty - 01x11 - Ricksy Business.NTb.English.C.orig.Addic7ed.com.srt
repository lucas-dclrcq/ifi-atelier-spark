1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,014
- Bye, mom! Bye, dad!
- Drive carefully!

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,103
Have fun, you two.

3
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:06,772
Yes, we will have as
much fun as possible on our...

4
00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:08,540
<i>Titanic</i> -themed getaway.

5
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,409
Let's lose the 'tude, please.

6
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:11,877
It's supposed to be romantic.

7
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:14,880
Speaking of disasters, dad, we
are leaving you in charge, here.

8
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:16,548
I know, c-can we wrap this up?

9
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,685
Morty and I have some synthetic
laser eels oxidizing in the garage.

10
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,553
Hey, don't blow me off.

11
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,122
I am drawing a line, okay?

12
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:26,458
Any damage to this house or
these children when we get back,

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,294
and... no more
adventures with Morty.

14
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:30,295
Aw, geez, Rick.

15
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:31,530
If my mom's the one
who's saying it,

16
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,399
then you know it's pretty
serious this time.

17
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:34,366
That's right.

18
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,234
Wait. What?

19
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:37,636
Listen, you have my
word as a caregiver,

20
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,138
everything's gonna be fine.

21
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,807
And if not, like you say, no
more adventures or whatever.

22
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:43,575
It's like that old song

23
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,744
"blomp blomp-a noop noop
a-noop noop noop".

24
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:47,413
You guys know that song?

25
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:48,580
From tiny rogerts?

26
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:49,581
You never heard of it?

27
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:52,317
You know, the black effeminate
guy from the '50s?

28
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:53,485
No-nobody?

29
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:54,653
A-all right, whatever.

30
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:55,587
Look, who cares?

31
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,723
Just go on your stupid trip.

32
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:00,559
Not one thing out of place.

33
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:05,798
Not a single thing.

34
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:18,666
Well, we're past the
point of no return.

35
00:01:18,692 --> 00:01:20,204
I'm going to have a party.

36
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:51,529

37
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:54,947
I found jello.
Can you sneak your mom's vodka?

38
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,882
Yes, she does.
I saw it in your laundry room.

39
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:59,685
Listen, you can't both be in
denial about it.

40
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:00,352
Okay, bye.

41
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:02,287
Summer, you can't
throw a party!

42
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,288
Remember what mom said?

43
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,325
Yeah, if anything gets messed up,
you and grandpa Rick get punished.

44
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:08,026
I'm only a human being, Morty.

45
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,928
Rick, tell summer she
can't have a party!

46
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,331
Uh, summer, you can't
have a party.

47
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,833
Because I'm having a
party, b-I-I-I-itch!

48
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:15,968
Oh, what?!

49
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:16,735
Rick, you can't!

50
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:18,804
What do you mean
you're having a party?

51
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:21,473
Are some glip glops from the
third dimension going to come

52
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,975
over and play cards or
something?

53
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:23,842
"Glip glop?"

54
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:25,844
You're lucky a traflorkian
doesn't hear you say that.

55
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,412
Is that like their n-word?

56
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:29,648
It's like the n-word
and the c-word had a baby and it

57
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,416
was raised by all the bad words
for Jews.

58
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:33,418
Listen, I think the three
of us could just, you know,

59
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,521
have a nice time, like
just hanging out, and, you know,

60
00:02:35,523 --> 00:02:36,522
doing a little bonding and --

61
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:37,523
screw that.

62
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:40,025
This is my chance to gain some
footing with the cool kids.

63
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:41,393
That's why you party?

64
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:42,427
Boy, you really are 17.

65
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:43,829
Why do you party?

66
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:46,765
To get wr-wriggedy
wriggedy wrecked, son!

67
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:49,998
Just keep your Sci-Fi friends
away from my awesome ones.

68
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:54,702
Yeah, and you keep your awesome
friends away from my canapes.

69
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,476
After dinner, <i>Titanic 2</i> will
attach to the rail system near

70
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,879
our replica iceberg, and the
hydraulics encased in these

71
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,882
tubes will execute a controlled
sink into the icy depths.

72
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:08,516
A rail system seems archaic for
an attraction this impressive.

73
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,355
Are you sure the ship will sink?

74
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,723
I can assure you the ship

75
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,959
will sink, as it has a thousand
times before.

76
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:16,361
It is un-unsinkable.

77
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,462
Ooh!

78
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,898
Look, it's the line
for the bow!

79
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,402
Jerry, I'd love to just kick
back with a Margarita and read.

80
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:25,571
Do you mind if I skip the whole
"king of the world" bit?

81
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:27,706
Well, it's not the
"king of the world" bit.

82
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,941
That's Jack and fabrizio.

83
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:32,444
This is where rose says, "I'm
flying, Jack!" But whatever.

84
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:33,879
I can be the only
one to do it alone.

85
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,447
Well, what about her?

86
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:36,415
Excuse me, ma'am.

87
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,717
Would you like to take
my place in line?

88
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,452
I, uh -- I could get into
trouble.

89
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,354
We won't tell.

90
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:43,789
So...

91
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,491
- You're a <i>Titanic</i> fanatic?
- Oh, yes.

92
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,066
I've worked here
since it opened,

93
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:49,962
but I've never been
able to participate.

94
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:52,297
Happy to help... rose.

95
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,400
I love watching bukkake.

96
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,803
I mean, like, I don't know if I
personally would ever do it...

97
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,404
Brad! Hey!

98
00:03:59,406 --> 00:03:59,906
Yo.

99
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:00,772
Brad is here!

100
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,441
Quick, make my hair look drunk.

101
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:03,575
Check it out.

102
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,943
Tammy's already drunk.

103
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:06,913
Cool.

104
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,448
The beacon was activated.

105
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,449
Who is in danger?

106
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:12,117
Ugh! Grandpa!

107
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,652
Birdperson!

108
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,420
I am pleased there is no
emergency.

109
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,122
Oh, there's an
emergency, all right.

110
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,423
A emergency!

111
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,592
When's the last time you got
laid, 'pers?

112
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:24,029
It has been a... challenging
mating season for birdperson.

113
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:26,465
Then it's time to get
your beak wet tonight, playah.

114
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:28,600
Go have some fun out there
birdp-- bird-- birdperson.

115
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,836
Oh, man, how many
people did you invite, Rick?

116
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:31,970
Uh... people?

117
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,840
Mm, six.

118
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:37,442
Yo! What up, my glip glops?!

119
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:38,444
Oh, man!

120
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:43,515
Oh!

121
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:45,753
Y-y-you know there's a garbage,
right?

122
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,688
Hey, uh, what the hell?!

123
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,990
Ooh. That's why you never
invite a floopy doop

124
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:54,726
and a shmoopy doop
to the same party.

125
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,664
Oh, oh, g--

126
00:04:58,666 --> 00:04:59,731
oh, that's disgusting!

127
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,166
You guys are in my parents' bed!

128
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,034
Oh. Sorry.

129
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:03,502
I'm not feeling too well.

130
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,470
I just needed to lie
down for a bit.

131
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,505
Oh. Okay.

132
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:07,706
S-s-sorry.

133
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,175
Oh, my God!

134
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,410
Are you kidding me?!

135
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:14,913
The thing people don't
realize about the Gear Wars is

136
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:18,483
that it was never really about
the gears at all.

137
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,184
Uh-huh. Yeah.

138
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:20,052
No, no, to-totally.

139
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:22,187
- Rick, you got to stop --
- Morty!

140
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,022
- Have you met gearhead?
- Hey, how's --

141
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,692
Morty here, he -- he would love
to hear all about the Gear Wars.

142
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:29,761
How familiar are you with the
Gear Wars, exactly?

143
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,863
Uh... Not at all.

144
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:32,864
Oh, boy.

145
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:33,732
I envy you.

146
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:37,836
Okay, it was about
754 years ago...

147
00:05:45,338 --> 00:05:46,146
Oh, hey, Morty!

148
00:05:46,148 --> 00:05:47,947
H-have you -- have you
met my buddy scropon?

149
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:48,981
Not again, Rick.

150
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:50,549
That last guy droned on for
20 minutes, you know?

151
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,617
And meanwhile, the whole house
is being destroyed!

152
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,920
Whoa, Morty, this guy's
entire planet was destroyed.

153
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:56,021
Have a little perspective.

154
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,123
Hey, Rick, squanchy
party, bro!

155
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,591
Aw! Squanchy!

156
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:01,860
Is there a good place for me
to <i>squanch</i> around here?

157
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,129
Squanchy, you can
squanch wherever you want, man.

158
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:07,566
- Mi casa es su casa, dawg!
- All right!

159
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:08,700
I like your squanch!

160
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,470
Uh, Rick, what exactly
is "squanching"?

161
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:13,872
Morty, listen -- we've
had a lot of really cool

162
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,608
adventures over the last year,
but it's time to relax.

163
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,211
Yeah, if I relax now, there might
not even be any more adventures!

164
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,046
Jesus, Morty, you're
bumming me out.

165
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,615
Can't we just pretend like
everything's fine for a few hours,

166
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:26,084
enjoy ourselves, and then
worry about all this later?

167
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,986
Yeah, that's easy for
you to say, Rick.

168
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,988
You know, you like not caring
about stuff.

169
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,925
You know, wh-wh-what's in this
for me?

170
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:39,664
For me?

171
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,933
Jessica.

172
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,735
Knock it off, slow mobius!

173
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,570
Ha ha! Sorry, dude!

174
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:49,975
I'm just trying to show off my
powers, bro!

175
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,643
I can't believe she's here.

176
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,678
Well, what are you
doing standing here, Morty?

177
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,679
Go. Talk to her.

178
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:58,183
Tonight, the only adventure you're
on is your cusping manhood.

179
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:02,788
Oh, Rose.

180
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,891
Whee!

181
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,793
Is that what I think it is?

182
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:09,094
Yes, every couple gets to

183
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,797
re-create Jack's drowning at the
end of the movie.

184
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:12,831
It's so romantic.

185
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,800
I can't wait to do
that with Beth.

186
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:15,801
I don't know, Jerry.

187
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:17,135
With all due respect, it seems

188
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,171
like your wife may not be that
interested.

189
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:20,305
Look!

190
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,841
<i>Iceberg, right ahead!
The buffet is now closed.</i>

191
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:25,877
<i>Iceberg, right ahead!
The buffet is now closed.</i>

192
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,045
Uh, sir?

193
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,613
There's not a problem.

194
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,116
What do you mean there's <i>not</i>
a problem?

195
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:34,686
The guidance system isn't putting
us on a direct collision course.

196
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:37,956
This ship is about to completely
miss the giant iceberg!

197
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,157
Well, do something!

198
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:39,958
Steer into it!

199
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,429
I'm trying!

200
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:45,997
It's too late.

201
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,165
Ladies and gentlemen...

202
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,333
Don't brace yourselves.

203
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:50,335
No! No!

204
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:51,336
What happened?!

205
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,672
Their rail system
must have failed.

206
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:54,339
Oh, my God!

207
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,808
We're not gonna sink!

208
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,744
Totally gonna get
laid tonight.

209
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:00,912
I like your feathers.

210
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,815
They are designed to attract
the attention of the female.

211
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:04,683
It's working.

212
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:07,352
Tammy, I should let you know
I just got out of a highly

213
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:10,655
intense soul bond with my
previous spirit mate.

214
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,358
I'm not looking to get into a
soul bond.

215
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,694
I'm just looking for...

216
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:18,029
I believe birdperson can
arrange that.

217
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:21,032
Hey, Summer, haven't seen you
at flute practice in a while.

218
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,268
Summer, don't tell me you're
friends with her.

219
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,703
Are you kidding me?

220
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:26,338
I don't even know what she's
doing here.

221
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,772
Whoa. Not cool, summer.

222
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,741
This is a party.
Everybody should be welcome.

223
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:32,944
Oh, great.

224
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,379
Who invited Abradolph Lincoler?

225
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,681
I thought everyone
was welcome.

226
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,350
It's not the same, Summer.

227
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,885
Lincoler is a crazed maniac --

228
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:42,754
just a misguided effort of mine
to create a morally neutral

229
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:46,124
superleader by combining the DNA of
Adolf Hitler and Abraham Lincoln.

230
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:50,195
Turns out it just adds
up to a lame, weird loser.

231
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,732
Rick, you brought me into
this world, a suffering

232
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:57,302
abomination tortured by the
duality of its being.

233
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:58,904
But I shall finally know peace

234
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:01,406
when I watch the life drain from
your wretched body!

235
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:02,807
Whoa. What's up, man?

236
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,743
I have no quarrel
with you, boy.

237
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:05,243
"Boy"?

238
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:06,778
What's that supposed to mean?

239
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,079
It's just -- l-look, I-I

240
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:10,916
don't know how you thought I
meant it, but...

241
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:12,250
Don't look at me, dude.

242
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:15,053
Look, I'm
half-Abraham Lincoln, so --

243
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,656
So I should get on my knees
and kiss your ass?!

244
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:19,824
Well, no, but...

245
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,159
- You know?
- What do I know?

246
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,662
That the third reich will reign
for a thousand years?

247
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:24,796
Leave him alone, Brad.

248
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,097
Stay out of this, Jessica!

249
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,265
Kick his ass, Brad!

250
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,333
Kick his ass!

251
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:29,768
Kick his ass!

252
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,136
Kick his ass!

253
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:32,103
Brad!

254
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:35,774
Rick!

255
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,711
I just did you a favor, Morty.

256
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,279
Sorry about all that.

257
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,114
Rick has some really strange
friends.

258
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,749
Ugh! Brad is such a jerk.

259
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,118
He's always trying to prove what
a man he is.

260
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,455
I just want to find somebody
nice and sweet.

261
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:53,893
Jessica, can I show
you something?

262
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:57,462
Wow! Look at all this stuff.

263
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:58,296
Yeah.

264
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,699
This is me and my grandpa Rick's
Sci-Fi workshop.

265
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,300
Check this out.

266
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,170
It's beautiful.

267
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:06,805
You know, Jessica,

268
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:09,307
there's something I've always
wanted to tell you.

269
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,475
What's that, Morty?

270
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:12,477
I think that
you're the most --

271
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:16,449
No, that -- those weird sounds
coming from the closet over there.

272
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,154
- Oh, my God!
- Aah!

273
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,489
Hey, I'm squanching in here!

274
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:25,490
Oh, my God!

275
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:26,825
Oh, that is so disgusting!

276
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,793
Ow! Oh! Oh, crap!

277
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:50,849
Huh.
Big star in the sky.

278
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,217
Oxygen-rich atmosphere.

279
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:53,885
Giant testicle monsters.

280
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,487
We'll be fine! Let's party!

281
00:11:02,957 --> 00:11:07,032
♪ Just shake that ass, bitch,
and let me see whatcha got ♪

282
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:12,037
I swear to God,
Morty, if it weren't for the

283
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,538
fact that everyone's still
having a blast in there,

284
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,006
I would be so furious
with you right now.

285
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:15,774
Oh, man.

286
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:16,875
Y-you hear that, Morty?

287
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,843
You really lucked out with
Summer o-on that one.

288
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,945
How are you guys not
freaking out right now?!

289
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:23,548
T-the whole house is sitting in
another dimension!

290
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,850
I-I mean, w-what the hell are we
supposed to do?!

291
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,719
M-m-mom and dad are
gonna kill us!

292
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:30,555
- I'm losing it here, Rick!
- Relax, Morty, relax!

293
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:31,723
It's gonna be fine.

294
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:35,560
All we have to do is go out and
find us some kalaxian crystals.

295
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,963
Oh, shit, mother [beep]!

296
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:41,132
Kalaxian crystals, Morty, just a
few miles South of here.

297
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,400
Okay. Let's go, then.

298
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,602
W-w-we got to go get those
crystals right now, Rick.

299
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:45,736
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

300
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,471
Morty, Morty, I-I can't go with
you.

301
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,973
I got to hang back and make sure

302
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,575
everything stays cool here, you
know?

303
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:53,578
I mean, who knows what -- what
if somebody breaks something?

304
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,646
Yeah. Me too.

305
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:55,213
I should stay.

306
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,581
You guys have any aspirin?

307
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,249
Oh, hey, Morty, this is
perfect!

308
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,651
You can take Lincoler with you.

309
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:01,252
Hey, man, I'm not going
anywhere.

310
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,254
- I'm injured.
- Shut up, Lincoler.

311
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:06,258
It's the least you can
do for wrecking the living room.

312
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:06,958
Yeah!

313
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,527
And, Nancy, you should go, too.

314
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,595
What? Why -- why me?

315
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,097
Because, uh,

316
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:15,936
you're -- you're so good at
playing the flute.

317
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,904
Sorry for the inconvenience,
folks.

318
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,673
We should resume sinking
shortly.

319
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:24,142
In the meantime, please, stay on
the ship and enjoy

320
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:27,111
a complimentary plate of
James Cameronion rings.

321
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,446
Great. Not only is the
ship not sinking,

322
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,782
but now the fourth wall
has been broken.

323
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,285
I am gonna go back to the room
to finish my book.

324
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,954
You should find
that Lucy woman.

325
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:37,122
But -- but --

326
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,124
You see, Jerry?

327
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:40,625
May I show you something?

328
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,093
Had everything gone as planned,

329
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,829
this entire area would be
underwater.

330
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:46,765
I would have liked to see it.

331
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,601
This trip has been a "Titanic"
failure.

332
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:50,668
Get it?

333
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,035
Ooh!

334
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:53,605
- Draw me, Jerry.
- Oh, boy.

335
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:54,806
Lucy, wow.

336
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:57,876
Uh, this isn't what I had in
mind.

337
00:12:57,878 --> 00:12:59,277
But it's the perfect moment.

338
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,546
We've been dreaming about this
for 16 years.

339
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:02,814
Um, not like this.

340
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:05,248
Not -- not with you.

341
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,685
- You are gonna draw me.
- Aah!

342
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:11,022
Then you're going to
[beep] me in that car over there.

343
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:15,359
It's weird, 'cause I definitely think
that all men are created equal.

344
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,594
But, at the same time --

345
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:17,562
Okay!

346
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,730
Um, the crystals should be
really close.

347
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:20,965
There they are!

348
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,335
Wait. Something's not right.

349
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,008
Get the crystals!
I'll handle the beast!

350
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,076
Prepare to be emancipated from

351
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,845
your own inferior genes!

352
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,548
Summer's gonna like me again.

353
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:45,056
Lincoler, come on!

354
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,157
Let's get out of here!

355
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,326
Mein journey is over, Morty.

356
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:53,132
I have something
important to tell you.

357
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:57,902
♪ And the gears, they turned
for a thousand years ♪

358
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:01,739
♪ until the dark day that they
stopped ♪

359
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:03,274
Rick, I got them!

360
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,176
- I got the crystals!
- All right!

361
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,878
- You did it, Morty.
- Rick, wait!

362
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,279
There's something you need to
know.

363
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:10,048
I couldn't have done it without
Lincoler.

364
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:13,051
He said that he was really sorry and
that he loves you like a father.

365
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,752
He only wanted you
to accept him,

366
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:17,355
and he hopes that his final act
would redeem him in your eyes.

367
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,058
He sacrificed himself to save
all of us, Rick.

368
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,725
He died.

369
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:23,261
Well, at least he
didn't die in vain.

370
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:25,497
He got these crystals.

371
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,701
And these babies just saved this
lame-ass party!

372
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:30,902
Wubba, lubba, dub, dub!

373
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:32,737
Play something.
Somebody, play something.

374
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,273
Wait a minute. What?

375
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:40,979
♪ Put your right foot forward ♪
♪ and your left foot back ♪

376
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:43,748
♪ then slide around ♪
♪ like on a nordictrack ♪

377
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,084
♪ move to the left ♪
♪ step to the right ♪

378
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:49,787
♪ wiggle your elbows, and look ♪
♪ up into the light ♪

379
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:54,726
♪ it's the, it's the ♪
♪ it's the Rick dance ♪

380
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:58,496
♪ it's the, it's the ♪
♪ it's the Rick dance ♪

381
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,931
Slow mobius, hit me
with the clock beam!

382
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:09,073
♪ It's the, it's the ♪
♪ it's the Rick dance ♪

383
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,808
That's the Rick dance!

384
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,409
All right!

385
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,777
Whoa, man!

386
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,681
What the hell was that?!

387
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:17,782
I thought those crystals were

388
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,350
supposed to help us get home or
something!

389
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:20,351
What? No, no, no.

390
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:21,986
I can get us home whenever I
want to.

391
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,549
But, listen, speaking
of those crystals,

392
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:24,789
can I get the rest of them?

393
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,257
I'm starting to come down,
Morty.

394
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,127
Crystal kalaxian is a really
strong, but fleeting high.

395
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,931
That's what I think of your
crystals, Rick!

396
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,766
Oh, Morty, you idiot!

397
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,101
Does anybody else have any more
k-lax?

398
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:37,869
B-birdperson?

399
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:38,469
Uh, squanchy?

400
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:39,837
Don't squaunch at me.

401
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,473
All right, everybody,
party is officially over!

402
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:43,808
Rick, take us home now.

403
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:47,145
All right, all right, fine,
Morty, you party pooper buzzkill!

404
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:48,212
Boo, boo! Morty sucks!

405
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,281
Boo! You suck, whatever your
name is.

406
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,049
Boo!

407
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:52,983
Morty, you're the worst, Morty.

408
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:55,320
But these gears just started
turnin'.

409
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:56,988
Almost finished, Jerry?

410
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,223
Uh, almost.

411
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:02,126
I haven't quite captured your
beautiful eyes.

412
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,728
I'm sure it's good enough.

413
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,128
Move!

414
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,298
Every weekend, Jacks and Roses
have their Titanic experience in

415
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,335
this car, and I
have to mop it up.

416
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:13,304
The floor drops out to make it
easier.

417
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,505
But now it's my turn.

418
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:18,309
We're going to get it nice and
steamy in there, and I'm going

419
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:22,313
to slam my hand on the steam and
leave a nice handprint, and then

420
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,882
you're going to love inside of
me.

421
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,517
No mess. No clean.

422
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:28,586
Beth!

423
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:31,858
Bet you're glad I think
kindles are dumb now.

424
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,226
I can't help but feel a little
guilty.

425
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:36,928
I didn't peg Lucy for a rapist.

426
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,831
What does a rapist
look like exactly, Beth?

427
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,900
Is it a slavic man wearing a
denim jacket with a patchy beard

428
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,933
and the scent of
cheap champagne

429
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,271
wafting over his
blister-pocked lips?

430
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,507
What?

431
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,409
Well, at least you got all this
free stuff.

432
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:54,846
Should be enough to satisfy your
<i>Titanic</i> Jones for a while.

433
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:57,281
I'm not going to fit.

434
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,050
Beth, listen to me.

435
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:00,218
You're going to get out of here.

436
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,285
You're gonna go on, and --

437
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:02,920
Jerry, just leave the door.

438
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,122
It's not a door, Beth.

439
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:05,556
- It's debris.
- I don't care.

440
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:06,924
Just leave it.

441
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:09,027
Yeah. Okay.

442
00:17:15,629 --> 00:17:18,536
"Cape fear"!
"Cape fear"!

443
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:22,069
I'm -- I'm doing -- I'm -- I'm going
to do like from "cape fear".

444
00:17:31,946 --> 00:17:33,511
Hey, squanchers!

445
00:17:33,537 --> 00:17:36,622
The party's squanching
on at my place!

446
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:39,123
Cool.
I'm coming, too.

447
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:39,590
Uh, no.

448
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,993
You're not squanchy enough for a
squanchy party.

449
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:42,894
What?

450
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,595
Nancy told us what a bitch
you are.

451
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:45,997
Guys, seriously.

452
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:46,330
Nancy?

453
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:48,266
Summer, you're a bad person.

454
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,835
All you care about is having
popular people like you.

455
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,970
That's not what
Abradolph Lincoler stood for.

456
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:55,173
Well, I-it was hard to pin down

457
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:58,710
<i>what</i> he stood for, but it's
certainly not what he died for.

458
00:18:02,012 --> 00:18:06,017
Next time I party, I'm just gonna
focus on getting totally wrecked.

459
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:07,285
You're so wise.

460
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,922
May I assist you with that?

461
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,156
Uh, sure, yeah.

462
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:12,590
Thanks.

463
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,426
Morty, do you know what
"wubba lubba dub dub" means?

464
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,463
Uh, that's just Rick's
stupid nonsense catchphrase.

465
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:19,964
It's not nonsense at all.

466
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:22,266
In my people's tongue, it means,

467
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,102
"I am in great pain.
Please help me."

468
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,636
Well, I got news for you.

469
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,138
He's saying it ironically.

470
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,939
No, Morty.

471
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,975
Your grandfather is, indeed, in
very deep pain.

472
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:33,044
That is why he must numb
himself.

473
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:34,145
Come on, um...

474
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:34,946
Birdperson.

475
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,180
Come on, birdperson.

476
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:37,515
Rick's not that complicated.

477
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:38,983
He's just a huge asshole.

478
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:42,019
Then why do you care so much
if you are no longer allowed to

479
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:43,988
continue on your adventures
together?

480
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,323
It appears fate has presented

481
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:48,858
you with an opportunity to free
yourself of Rick forever.

482
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,394
You know what? You're right.
I shouldn't even care.

483
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:53,064
This is probably the best thing
that could have happened to me.

484
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:54,899
I'm sick of having adventures
with Rick.

485
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:58,336
My people have another saying--
"gubba nub nub doo rah kah".

486
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:01,172
It means, "whatever lets you
sleep at night".

487
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:05,409
Guys, mom and dad are, like,
right around the corner.

488
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,044
This is your moment, Morty.

489
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:08,246
Choose wisely.

490
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:09,580
Tammy!

491
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,749
Caw!

492
00:19:15,651 --> 00:19:19,290
Wow.
We are so screwed.

493
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:20,525
- Rick, wake up.
- Huh? What? Wait? What?

494
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:21,092
What? Stop.

495
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:22,660
Rick, you got to do
something quick.

496
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,127
My parents are home.

497
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,396
Uh, all -- all right.

498
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:26,998
All right. Hold -- hold on.

499
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:28,933
Ahh! So good.

500
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,735
Oh, my God.
They're walking up the driveway.

501
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,671
- Bring me the thing.
- What -- what thing?

502
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:34,305
The thing. The thing.

503
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:37,041
The -- the -- it's got, like,
buttons on it and lights on it.

504
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:37,708
It -- it -- it beeps.

505
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,409
Rick!

506
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,111
That describes everything in
your garage!

507
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:41,212
Do you mean this?

508
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:43,882
Summer for for the win.

509
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:46,050
All right, that should do it.

510
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:47,218
Whoa!
What did you do?

511
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,454
Uh, s-see for yourself.

512
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:50,721
Whoa!

513
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,957
Yeah, e-everything's
frozen in time.

514
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,959
Yeah, and slow mobius thinks
he's all that.

515
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:57,061
- For how long?
- I don't know.

516
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,730
How long do you guys want?
A week? A month?

517
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:03,367
Can we start cleaning
the house and see how we feel?

518
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:28,627
- Worst movie ever.
- Dumb.

519
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:31,260
Ooh, boy, what a
waste of time.

520
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:31,662
Get it?

521
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,231
You know, 'cause it's frozen.

522
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,166
This has been so much fun.

523
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:36,234
Hey, Rick.

524
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:39,003
You know, this whole time, I
haven't once heard you say that

525
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,738
"wubba lubba dub dub" thing that
you usually say.

526
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,639
Don't need to.

527
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:43,641
I have a new catchphrase.

528
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:44,575
Oh, yeah?

529
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,643
What -- what's that, Rick?

530
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:47,078
I love my grandkids.

531
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,145
- Aww.
- Psych!

532
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:51,248
Just kidding -- my new
catchphrase is, "I don't give a [beep]".

533
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:55,086
♪ Just shake that ass, bitch,
and let me see whatcha got ♪

534
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:58,356
♪ just shake that ass, bitch,

535
00:20:58,358 --> 00:20:59,257

537
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,459
Roll the credits! Go!

538

♪ Just shake that ass

539
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:04,128
That's the end of season one!

540
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,529
That's the end, mother [beep]!

541
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,798
"I don't give a [beep]" is my
new catchphrase!

542
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,300
[Beep] you!

543
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:11,302
That's season one! Boom!

544
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:14,505
Season one up in your face,
mother [beep]!

545
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:15,439
Yeah!

546
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:51,743
Revenge.
What?!

547
00:21:55,745 --> 00:21:59,553
Party!
Whoo, baby!

548
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:02,278
Please, stop!

549
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,322
Hey, brah!

550
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,690
I don't understand.

551
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:07,191
Are you enjoying this?

552
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:08,259
Do you like this?

553
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:10,695
Yeah, you know it, dawg!

554
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:13,064
Whoo, baby!

555
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:20,089
