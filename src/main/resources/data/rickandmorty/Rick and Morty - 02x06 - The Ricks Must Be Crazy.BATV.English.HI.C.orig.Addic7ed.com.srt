00:06:55,796 --> 00:06:57,296
No more gooble boxes.

173
00:06:57,331 --> 00:06:59,265
RICK: I got to tell you, Zeep,
with no disrespect,

174
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:01,667
I really think what
you're doing here is unethical.

175
00:07:01,702 --> 00:07:03,136
- It's not cool.
- What?!

176
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,105
Y-y-you got the people
on this world slaving away

177
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,840
[burps] making your power.

178
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,342
I mean,
that's what I call slavery.

179
00:07:09,376 --> 00:07:11,277
No, no, no,
they work for each other

180
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:13,546
in exchange for money,
which they then--

181
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,749
Well, that just sounds like
slavery with extra steps.

182
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:20,586
Eek barba dirkle, somebody's
gonna get laid in college.

183
00:07:20,621 --> 00:07:21,888
Rick, a word?

184
00:07:21,922 --> 00:07:23,022
What the hell was that?

185
00:07:23,056 --> 00:07:24,824
I know.
"Eek barba dirkle"?

186
00:07:24,858 --> 00:07:26,626
That's a pretty
[bleep] up "ooh-la-la".

187
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,294
No, what are you doing
telling this guy

188
00:07:28,328 --> 00:07:29,962
that his miniverse is
unethical?

189
00:07:29,997 --> 00:07:32,098
Do you not see
the hypocrisy here?

190
00:07:32,132 --> 00:07:34,000
Holy crap.
You're right, Morty.

191
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:35,601
Hypocrisy.

192
00:07:35,636 --> 00:07:37,737
Somewhere on this planet,
there's got to be

193
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:40,039
an arrogant scientist prick on the
verge of microverse technology,

194
00:07:40,107 --> 00:07:42,341
which would threaten to make
Zeep's flooble cranks obsolete,

195
00:07:42,376 --> 00:07:44,143
forcing Zeep to say
microverses are bad,

196
00:07:44,178 --> 00:07:47,046
at which point he'll realize
what a hypocrite he's being,

197
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,982
his people will go back to
stomping on their gooble boxes,

198
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:52,351
and you and I will be
on ice cream street, baby!

199
00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:54,187
Eating that mother[bleep]
ice cream!

200
00:07:54,221 --> 00:07:56,188
Slurping, slurping,
slurping it up.

201
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,391
Wh-wh-why are you making
that face?

202
00:07:58,425 --> 00:07:59,859
Holy [bleep]!

203
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:00,949
It's me.

204
00:08:00,974 --> 00:08:02,995
I've convinced the people of
this planet that I'm a traveler

205
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,996
from another world.

206
00:08:04,031 --> 00:08:05,998
You don't think that's
over[Burps]doing it a little?

207
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:07,667
I mean, you could achieve
the same effect

208
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:08,968
with a pair of--
Never mind.

209
00:08:09,002 --> 00:08:10,403
You know what?
I shouldn't be so critical.

210
00:08:10,437 --> 00:08:11,804
I'm an alien.

211
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,840
Places, please.
We're about to land.

212
00:08:17,177 --> 00:08:19,745
[Coughs]
Too fast.

213
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:22,315

Come out with your hands up,

227

Bomb! Bomb!

229
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:02,504
Daddy?

230
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:04,506
Oh, my God.
[Sighs]

231
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,174
- Hunter?
- Daddy?

232
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,943
What the hell?

233
00:09:07,977 --> 00:09:10,278
[Gasps] Jesus Christ,
cease fire! Stay back!

234
00:09:10,313 --> 00:09:11,446
H-h-hunter?

235
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,248
- Daddy.
- Hunter!

236
00:09:13,282 --> 00:09:15,250
[Sobbing] Oh, my dear,
sweet God, Hunter.

237
00:09:15,284 --> 00:09:16,585
Oh, my boy.
My boy.

238
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:19,054
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It was all my fault.

239
00:09:19,088 --> 00:09:21,256
- I'm sorry.
- Daddy, leave the car alone.

240
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,424
W-w-w-what?

241
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:24,526
[Distorted]
Leave the car alone.

242
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,194
Hunter?
Don't--

243
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:27,329
Oh, my God.

244
00:09:27,363 --> 00:09:29,631
Stay here, Hunter!
No!

245
00:09:29,665 --> 00:09:32,567
[Sobbing] God, no!
Hunter!

And if you continue
to turn your flooble cranks,

251
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:50,118
I will bring you
other great alien advancements.

252
00:09:50,152 --> 00:09:52,454
- Hey, uh, let me ask you something.
- Yes?

253
00:09:52,488 --> 00:09:55,056
Any of your, uh, scientists
working on anything new?

254
00:09:55,124 --> 00:09:56,591
All of them.
That's their job.

255
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:59,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But I mean, like, energy-wise.

256
00:09:59,128 --> 00:10:01,496
Anyone working on, say,
a little universe in a box?

257
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,632
How do you know about that?
It's top secret.

258
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:07,569
ZEEP: So remember-- a crank
a day is not nearly enough.

259
00:10:07,603 --> 00:10:09,270
[Laughs]
Crank it.

260
00:10:09,338 --> 00:10:12,107
I told them this means
"Peace among worlds".

261
00:10:12,141 --> 00:10:15,210
- How hilarious is that?
- Re-really funny, Zeep.

262
00:10:15,244 --> 00:10:17,579
Hey, Zeep, the fake president
of your fake world

263
00:10:17,613 --> 00:10:19,681
has something fake important
to show you.

264
00:10:22,151 --> 00:10:23,052
It's not much now,

265
00:10:23,077 --> 00:10:25,454
but once I learn to accelerate
the temporal field,

266
00:10:25,488 --> 00:10:27,622
I'll be able to interact
with any sentient life

267
00:10:27,657 --> 00:10:29,457
that evolves and introduce them

268
00:10:29,492 --> 00:10:32,227
to the wonders of electricity
via a pulley-based device

269
00:10:32,294 --> 00:10:33,495
I call a blooble yank.

270
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:35,897
But what
they won't know is--

271
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:37,666
You'll be taking
most of their energy.

272
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,234
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I get it.

273
00:10:39,268 --> 00:10:41,603
[Burps]
It's show[Burps]time.

274
00:10:45,374 --> 00:10:48,943
You do realize this will make
the flooble crank obsolete?

275
00:10:48,978 --> 00:10:52,280
This is wrong, Kyle.
What you're doing is wrong.

276
00:10:52,348 --> 00:10:54,582
You're basically--
This is slavery.

277
00:10:54,617 --> 00:10:57,118
You're talking about creating
a planet of slaves.

278
00:10:57,153 --> 00:11:00,455
- [Burps] Told you, Zeep.
- Oh, they won't be slaves.

279
00:11:00,489 --> 00:11:02,624
They'll work for each other
and pay each other money.

280
00:11:02,658 --> 00:11:07,696
That just sounds like slavery
with ex... tra... steps.

281
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,497
- What?
- Wait a minute.

282
00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:12,167
Did you create my universe?
Is my universe a miniverse?

283
00:11:12,234 --> 00:11:14,502
- Microverse!
- Uh, teenyverse.

284
00:11:14,537 --> 00:11:16,337
Ugh!
You bastard!

285
00:11:16,405 --> 00:11:18,473
Much obliged.

286
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:20,997
- What the hell is happening?
- This is healthy, trust me.

287
00:11:21,177 --> 00:11:23,011
You're my battery, mother[bleep].

288
00:11:23,045 --> 00:11:24,312
[Groans]
That's all you are.

289
00:11:24,346 --> 00:11:26,314
I made you.
Your microverse sucks!

290
00:11:26,338 --> 00:11:28,938
And your miniverse is the size
of a [bleep] lobster tank!

291
00:11:28,962 --> 00:11:29,718
It's whack!

292
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:32,020
Are they not really aliens?

293
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:36,191
Nah, they're just a couple of crazy,
wacky scientists, you know?

294
00:11:36,225 --> 00:11:37,592
So he made a universe,

295
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:39,294
and that guy is
from <i>that</i> universe.

296
00:11:39,328 --> 00:11:41,629
And that guy made a universe.

297
00:11:41,664 --> 00:11:45,233
And that's the universe
where I was born.

298
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:47,469
Where my father died.

299
00:11:47,503 --> 00:11:49,704
Where I couldn't make time
for his funeral

300
00:11:49,772 --> 00:11:54,209
because I was working
on my universe.

301
00:11:54,243 --> 00:11:56,010
- I made you!
- [Laughs] Yeah.

302
00:11:56,045 --> 00:11:57,712
Science, huh?
Ain't it a thing.

303
00:11:57,747 --> 00:12:00,048
You know, one time,
Rick sh-- accidentally shot

304
00:12:00,082 --> 00:12:01,683
his laser pistol
right through my hand.

305
00:12:01,717 --> 00:12:05,286
You know, I mean, like,
old-lady science, you know?

306
00:12:05,321 --> 00:12:07,122
She's a real--

307
00:12:07,156 --> 00:12:08,456
You got to hang on tight,
you know?

308
00:12:08,491 --> 00:12:11,292
Because she-- she'll--
She bucks pretty hard.

309
00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:14,329
Ooh, boy, what--
Oh, my God, no!

310
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:20,435
- Teenyverse.
- Teenyverse.

311
00:12:22,152 --> 00:12:24,119
Come on, come on, come on.

312
00:12:24,154 --> 00:12:25,254
Pterodactyl!

313
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:27,290
[Laughs]
Asshole!

314
00:12:27,324 --> 00:12:28,925
When I get
out of this teenyverse,

315
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,827
I'm gonna smash it to pieces
with you in it.

316
00:12:30,861 --> 00:12:32,562
Yeah, well, when I get
out of this teenyverse,

317
00:12:32,596 --> 00:12:34,430
I'm gonna get out of
the surrounding miniverse

318
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:36,399
and then the microverse
around that, and guess what?

319
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:37,900
Don't make things worse, Rick!

320
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:39,902
Uh, he's not gonna destroy
your universe.

321
00:12:39,937 --> 00:12:41,904
You know, we--
We need it to start our car.

322
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:44,273
That's what you used
my universe for?

323
00:12:44,308 --> 00:12:45,942
To run your car?

324
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:47,343
Yeah, but don't
flatter yourself.

325
00:12:47,378 --> 00:12:50,079
There's always AAA,
you [bleep] [bleep]sucker!

326
00:12:51,148 --> 00:12:53,015
What's he doing?
What's he crafting?

327
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,517
I can craft stuff, too, pal!

328
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:56,386
Just like I crafted
your reality!

329
00:12:57,654 --> 00:12:59,055
You crafty son of a--

330
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:00,289
Ow!

331
00:13:00,324 --> 00:13:03,926
I crafted the guy that created
the planet you're standing on!

332
00:13:03,961 --> 00:13:06,362
Yeah, and I made the stars that became
the carbon in your mother's ovaries!

333
00:13:06,397 --> 00:13:08,164
I didn't ask to be born!

334
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:09,599
All right, that's it!
I'm out.

335
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:11,467
I-I'm gonna go
into the wilderness,

336
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:14,470
and I'm gonna make a new life for
myself among the tree people.

337
00:13:14,505 --> 00:13:16,906
- It can't be worse than this.
- RICK: Sure. Okay, Morty.

338
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,342
Just be back before sundown
or the tree people will eat you.

339
00:13:19,409 --> 00:13:20,376
That's a myth!

340
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:22,311
W-w-why are you trying
to start a myth?

341
00:13:22,346 --> 00:13:23,880
It's a prehistoric planet, Morty.

342
00:13:23,947 --> 00:13:25,448
Someone has to bring
a little culture.

343
00:13:25,482 --> 00:13:27,116
And it certainly can't be someone

344
00:13:27,151 --> 00:13:30,286

Oh, my God.
Oh, God.

- Correct.

<i>You also refuse to authorize
emotional countermeasures.</i>

353
00:13:51,537 --> 00:13:54,505
If you're talking
about the melting ghost babies,

354
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,474

Raah!

I hope your God is
as big a dick as you.

My God's the biggest dick
that's never existed.

[Snake hisses]

371
00:14:43,532 --> 00:14:45,198
[Eagle screeches]
You're here

372
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:47,401
because you created
someone smarter than you.

373
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:53,373
Oh, I thought we were both here because
I created a universe of idiots.

I haven't seen you in months.

You're leading the tree people?

378
00:15:06,854 --> 00:15:08,288
Huh.
That's a step up.

379
00:15:08,322 --> 00:15:09,489
We have no leaders.

380
00:15:09,557 --> 00:15:12,125
We follow
only the will of the forest.

381
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,293
Ooh. Wow.

00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:16,363
- Gaaaaay.
- That is pretty gay.

383
00:15:16,397 --> 00:15:18,231
You two call yourselves
geniuses,

384
00:15:18,266 --> 00:15:20,867
but you have spent
this time learning nothing.

385
00:15:20,902 --> 00:15:22,769
Come with me into the forest.

386
00:15:22,804 --> 00:15:25,338
There is something
I wish to teach you.

This is ku'ala,

For generations,
it has guided the--

You have to get us
the [bleep] out of here.

390
00:15:37,718 --> 00:15:39,553
These people are
backwards savages.

391
00:15:39,587 --> 00:15:41,188
They eat every third baby

392
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:43,356
because they think
it makes fruit grow bigger.

393
00:15:43,391 --> 00:15:45,892
Everyone's gross, and they all
smell like piss all the time.

I miss my laptop.

I masturbated to an extra-curvy
piece of driftwood the other day!

Look, I don't care
what it takes.

No can do, Morty.
I just can't.

I've certainly seen

If this works,
drinks are on me.

If drinks are on you,
you're gonna need

Sure, I just need to go grab
my wallet from inside my ship.

Isour wallet in your ship?

A long time ago, I implanted you

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,854
He knew that once I got
back to my car,

513
00:20:29,888 --> 00:20:31,789
one of two things
was gonna happen--

514
00:20:31,823 --> 00:20:33,858
I was gonna have to toss
a broken battery,

515
00:20:33,892 --> 00:20:36,727
or the battery wouldn't
be broken.

516
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:45,035
Peace among worlds, Rick.

517
00:20:45,103 --> 00:20:46,237
Jesus.

518
00:20:46,271 --> 00:20:48,572
Yeah.
Listen to that baby purr.

519
00:20:48,607 --> 00:20:49,374
You were right, Morty--

520
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:51,142
We really just needed to
be honest with those guys.

521
00:20:51,176 --> 00:20:52,376
All right, here we go.

522
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,814
Thank y-o-o-ou.

523
00:20:56,848 --> 00:20:58,816
See, Morty?
This is what it's all about.

524
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,284
This is why we do what we do.

525
00:21:00,318 --> 00:21:01,785
- Uh-huh.
- Ew! What the hell?

526
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:03,954
Jesus!
There's flies in my ice cream.

527
00:21:03,989 --> 00:21:05,222
Presidential decree--

528
00:21:05,257 --> 00:21:09,326
All ice cream is now for all beings,
no matter how many legs.

529
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:11,428
- What the [bleep] did you do, Summer?!
- It was your ship!

530
00:21:11,463 --> 00:21:13,063
- Your stupid ship did it!
- Don't blame my ship!

531
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:14,932
- It melted a child!
- My ship doesn't do anything...

532
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:16,467
- It killed it itself!
- ...unless it's told to do something!

533
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:18,341
- We almost died!
- I don't want to hear it, Summer!

534
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,404
[Shouting indistinctly]
Your boobs are all hanging about,

535
00:21:20,472 --> 00:21:22,373
and you ruined ice cream
with your boobs out.

536
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:24,108
And don't even try
to deny it, either.

537
00:21:24,142 --> 00:21:25,242
