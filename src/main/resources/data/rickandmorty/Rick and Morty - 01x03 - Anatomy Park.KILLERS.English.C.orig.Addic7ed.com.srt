00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,965
Mmm.

5
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,665
Jerry, you are really
giving it to this ham.

6
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,665
Um, merry Christmas.
Hello?

7
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,951
My parents are coming over for
the first time in years.

8
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,510
Can we stow the gadgets
and look alive?

9
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,325
Alive?
For your parents?

10
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,265
- Mm, good one.
- Hey, man!

11
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,525
You "hey, man!"
This holiday is about humanity.

12
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,325
You know, I thought it was about
being born half-God or something.

13
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,625
Whatever.

14
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,750
All electronic items are going
in the stocking now.

15
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,009
Dad, I'm not giving
you my phone.

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,640
Put it in the stocking, Summer,
or I'm joining Facebook.

17
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:10,795
A-ho, ho, ho,
everybody.

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,125
More like "whoa, whoa, whoa."

19
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,699
What is this?
My parents are coming!

20
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,830
Calm down, Jerry.

21
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:16,165
This is Reuben, an old friend.

22
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:16,930
Pearl harbor.

23
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:20,650
I check in on him once a year and give
him a little medical evaluation.

24
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,625
Aww!

25
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,965
Dad, that is so sweet!

26
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,765
Yeah, it is.

27
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,995
I don't get it.

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,765
Korea.

29
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,924
Don't worry about your
Christmas, Jerry.

30
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:31,410
I'll be with Reuben in my workshop

31
00:01:31,419 --> 00:01:34,479
while you guys are having another day
in Phil Collins' proverbial paradise.

32
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,489
Huh.
You think you know a guy.

33
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,120
Okay, there's my parents.

34
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,364
Now, remember no TV, no
phones, no laptops.

35
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:45,615
We are connecting this Christmas,
like old-school Jews on a Saturday.

36
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,194
- Hey, hey!
- Merry Christmas, son.

37
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,965
Uh, hi.
Can I help you?

38
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,724
Jerry, this is Jacob.
Didn't you get our text message?

39
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:53,765
No!

40
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,495
You must be Jerry.
That's a fine-looking apron.

41
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,995
- Williams-sonoma?
- I wish!

42
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,519
But thank you.

43
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,894
So, you're a...
friend of the family?

44
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:05,724
Uh, the way we see it, he's a
part of the family.

45
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:06,825
Wow.

46
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,325
After your father's brush
with cancer and losing your Uncle,

47
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,695
we looked at life and wondered,
how have we spent it,

48
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,495
and how do we spend
the rest of it?

49
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,165
What are we going to
be when we die...

50
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,465
a list of fears and questions or a
collection of real experiences?

51
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,625
Holy crap.
Joyce, that's amazing.

52
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,495
Then Jacob came into our lives,

53
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,819
and... we're learning to
live again.

54
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,195
All three of us.

55
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:33,025
Cool.

56
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,164
- Eggnog?
- Now we are talking!

57
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,224
This man's got the apron
and the eggnog, huh?

58
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,220
Hi, Joyce. Leonard.

59
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,065
- Hello, there.
- Merry Christmas, man.

60
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,765
Morty, a moment of your time?

61
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,724
He's in bad shape, Morty.

62
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:47,365
Aw, geez, Rick.
What'd you do?

63
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,490
Gee, thanks, Morty.

64
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,070
What kind of monster do you
think I am?

65
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,324
I'm sitting here trying to
save the guy's life.

66
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:53,264
I need your help.

67
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:54,925
I want you to find
Dr. Xenon Bloom.

68
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,131
He'll know what's going on.

69
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,995
Uh, where
where do I find Dr. Bloom?

70
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,880
In Reuben.

71
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:03,065
- Reuben, Minnesota?
- Reuben on the table, Morty.

72
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,269
Look, I don't have time for you to wrap
your little walnut around everything.

73
00:03:07,344 --> 00:03:08,864
Just hold your breath
until the process

74
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,609
is over or your lungs
will collapse.

75
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,190
What proc-

76
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:17,525
- Hey, dad, where's Morty?
- He's busy.

77
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,595
<i>Morty, can you hear me?
Head north.</i>

78
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,025
Rick, where am I?

79
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,845
Depending on my aim, you should
be just South of the entrance.

80
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,425
Entrance to what?

81
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,625
Welcome, Morty.

82
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,425
Welcome...

83
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,224
...to anatomy park!

84
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:36,895
It's a little business venture
I've been cooking up on the side

85
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,465
with Dr. Bloom an amusement
park inside a human body.

86
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,525
Science isn't cheap, Morty.

87
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,764
This should really help put a
dent in the overhead.

88
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:45,895
Oh, my God!
This is insane!

89
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,425
Spleen Mountain?
Bladder falls?

90
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,264
Pirates of the pancreas?

91
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:51,109
You got a problem with
that last one, Morty?

92
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,070
Huh? No, no.

93
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,164
I'm just reading 'em out loud in
the order that I'm seeing 'em.

94
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:55,289
Okay. All right.

95
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:56,895
If I sounded a little defensive,
it's because...

96
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,465
pirates of the pancreas was my
baby.

97
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,865
You know, I got I got a lot of
pushback when I pitched it, Morty.

98
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,465
I guess I'm still a little
defensive.

99
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,895
Let's just find Dr. Bloom,
all right?

100
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,824
I'm picking up a distress
signal in the liver, Morty.

101
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:07,689
Proceed to the liver.

102
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,125
<i>Arriving at...</i>

103
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:14,925
<i>...liver.</i>

104
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:15,894
Ow!

105
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,518
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

106
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:21,565
It's really scary in here, Rick.

107
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,125
<i>The liver's under maintenance.</i>

108
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,490
<i>Reuben's seen some rough years,
Morty.</i>

109
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:25,194
<i>Don't judge.</i>

110
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:29,545
<i>You don't agree to have a theme park built
inside you if your life's going great.</i>

111
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,495
Rick! It's a monster!

112
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,701
<i>No, no, no. Morty.</i>

113
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,795
<i>The only monster here is
alco...... holism.</i>

114
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,595
<i>That is an animatronic werewolf.</i>

115
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:41,694
Who are you?!
Answer me!

116
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:42,725
Where'd you come from?

117
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,365
My my my grandpa Rick sent me!

118
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,425
Poncho!

119
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,894
That's quite enough.

120
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:48,894
Morty, that's Poncho.

121
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:50,365
This is Roger and Annie.

122
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,325
And I am Dr. Xenon Bloom.

123
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,264
<i>Hey, Bloom, it's Rick.</i>

124
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:57,264
<i>What the hell's going on here?</i>

125
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:01,595
I don't know why, but the
entire security system has shut down,

126
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,495
and I'm afraid... the
exhibits are unlocked.

127
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,995
Exhibits?

128
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,894
Anatomy park's greatest attraction,

129
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:11,964
young man, isn't the
music or the food or the...

130
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:13,049
Pirates of the pancreas.

131
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,194
<i>Watch it.</i>

132
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,964
It is, first and foremost,

133
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:20,165
a living museum of humanity's most
noble and ferocious diseases.

134
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,325
Diseases?

135
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:22,595
Hey, doc.

136
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,765
I got news for you.

137
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,065
Your living museum is officially
a wild safari!

138
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,995
Hepatitis A! Run!

139
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,394
Oh, the food goes in
your mouth, girl.

140
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:40,565
Oh, Jacob.

141
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,565
I'm sorry, Jacob.

142
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,811
I guess I'm still confused

143
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:46,194
about the precise nature and

144
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,725
origin of your relationship with
my parents.

145
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,425
Are you, like, uh are you,
like, their caretaker?

146
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,310
Is that what it is?

147
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,894
- We can go into detail later, son.
- Now, wait.

148
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:55,865
Th-there's no point to secrecy.

149
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,824
Let's all live and die honestly.

150
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:00,795
Your mother and I have shared
40 years of each other, mind,

151
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,824
body, and soul, and when minds
and souls are joined for

152
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:08,065
eternity and when eternity is
at the door, it's an invitation

153
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,149
to let go of the body and an
opportunity to share and experiment.

154
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,130
Dad, please.

155
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,125
What are you saying?

156
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,779
Whatever it is, it's beautiful,
Leonard, and we support you.

157
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:19,270
Hey, speak for
yourself, because it...

158
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,675
sounds like you're about to
say Jacob is your lover.

159
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,295
No, no, no, no, no, no.

160
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,995
Jacob is your mother's lover.

161
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,095
I watch them sometimes...

162
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,524
from a chair and sometimes from a closet,
almost always dressed as superman.

163
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:37,725
Oh.

164
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,610
Jerry, this ham has got to be
all you, right?

165
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,925
It's incredible.

166
00:06:42,794 --> 00:06:45,725
Happy human holiday, dad.

167
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:46,964
Aah!

168
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:54,125
Hepatitis won't follow us
into the respiratory system.

169
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,225
That's strange.

170
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,894
Airflow is down 20%.

171
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:59,495
So, the brain isn't getting
enough oxygen.

172
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,820
That's why security's offline.

173
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:03,549
Well, I guess we
better check it out.

174
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:07,964
Hey! Wait for me!

175
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:11,824
Put that back on!

176
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:14,675
If we got up to the bronchial catwalk,
we could look for a blockage.

177
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,795
I'll go.

178
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,795
- Don't be a hero, kid.
- I'm not.

179
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,125
I'm doing it because it's fun.

180
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,324
We shouldn't be here.

181
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:26,295
Whatever you do, do not fire
that thing in here.

182
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,971
We must save Reuben.
This is my life's work.

183
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:32,324
It's all right, my dear.

184
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:34,295
Nearly all human lungs contain...

185
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:39,024
a strain of these bacteria, but
the scar tissue keeps them...

186
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:40,125
Dormant.

187
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,630
- Morty, get down!
- Whoa-ho-ho!

188
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,925
Whoa!

189
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,725
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

190
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,464
Oh, what are those things?

191
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:53,795
Tuberculosis coming in fast!

192
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,041
Not faster than a bullet!

193
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:55,995
Aah!

194
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,194
No!

195
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,725
Do you know what you've done?!

196
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,648
Whoa!

197
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,524
Get to the digestive tract!

198
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:06,295
He's coughing!

199
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,324
Whoaaaa!

200
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:10,365
Don't let me die!

201
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,095
Just take a deep breath, Reuben.

202
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,595
You're not gonna die!

203
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,565
What's your name?

204
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,510
My name is...

205
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,964
Alexand-

206
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,394
Rick r-r-Reuben's
got tuberculosis!

207
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,495
Oh, great work, Morty.

208
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,900
Okay, I'll just
cure it and then-

209
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,194
Okay.

210
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,795
Well, I can't cure death.

211
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,095
This is bad, Morty.

212
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,380
You're trapped in a dead man.

213
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,789
Listen, if the situation
keeps darkening,

214
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,495
do yourself a favor and pop
by pirates of the pancreas.

215
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,965
Obviously I'm biased, but I
think it's great, Morty.

216
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,099
It's a bunch of Pirates
running around a Pancreas.

217
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:46,225
We don't whitewash
it, either, Morty.

218
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,565
I mean, the pirates
are really rapey.

219
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,125
The top priority is to get, you
know, you guys out of there,

220
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,365
but I'm just saying, if that
becomes impossible,

221
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,388
please, you gotta
treat yourself.

222
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:58,095
Oh, man.
What is that horrible smell?

223
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,301
You mean the panda express?

224
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,195
Kidding. I-I'm kidding.

225
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,625
The body is beginning to
constrict and fill with gas.

226
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,825
We're inside a corpse, my boy.

227
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,871
Anatomy park is doomed.

228
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,894
Forget about the park, doctor!

229
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:11,924
How do we get out?

230
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:14,225
The digestive tract is the
evacuation route.

231
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,365
Get it?

232
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,495
There's an emergency station in

233
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,995
the colon with a ray that can
enlarge us all.

234
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,965
Everybody, head for the colon!

235
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,865
Now I'm taking orders from a
12-year-old boy?

236
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:28,274
Morty, the scar sacs containing
the tuberculosis were sabotaged.

237
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:30,825
This disaster was an inside job.

238
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,195
Keep your eye on Annie.

239
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,174
She was written up several times by
her manager at the churro stand.

240
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:39,024
Intestines are ahead to the left,

241
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:44,024
then to the right, then
left, et cetera.

242
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:46,764
Hey, just so you know,
I'm actually 14.

243
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:47,595
So, you know...

244
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,325
What?

245
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,495
- Not 12.
- Okay.

246
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,024
You know, because he
just said I was 12.

247
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:55,065
Oh.

248
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,865
Good for you.

249
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,924

Don't move.

Gonorrhea can't see us if we
don't move.

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,195
- Yes. Why?

Jerry, come on.
This is what you wanted.

283
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:28,495
I get it, Beth.
Be careful what you wish for.

284
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,995
I'm being punished for taking
your iPad.

285
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,125
What?
Jerry, let that stuff go, okay?

286
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,565
I'm sorry I was a bitch earlier.
Let's just be here.

287
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,465
- Summer!
- Ethan?

288
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,625
What are you doing here?

289
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,095
I've been texting you for hours!

290
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,095
What the hell?!

291
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,595
I don't have my phone!

292
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,095
I'm doing a human holiday!

293
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,995
Well, did you even consider
how that might make me feel?!

294
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,125
How you feel?!

295
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,365
Why is everything always
happening to you?!

296
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,394
Summer, do you have a boyfriend?

297
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,725
Yeah, do you, Summer?

298
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,095
I don't know, Ethan.
Do I?!

299
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:02,345
Jerry, no disrespect, but you really need
to connect more with your family, man.

300
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,164
I should be able to access...

301
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:06,325
the backup generator to get the
growth ray online.

302
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,225
If it works, we'll be
regular-sized in a few minutes.

303
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,031
I just hope Reuben's not in a room
with white carpets or upholstery.

304
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,565
- What the hell is that?
- The sphincter dam.

305
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,424
We built it when Reuben
became incontinent,

306
00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:20,895
but it was not designed
to hold a corpse load.

307
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,325
I've almost got it.

308
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,995
Everybody, move
inside the circle.

309
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,995
Poncho?
What is this in your backpack?

310
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,065
That's bubonic plague!

311
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,630
What are you doing with that,
Poncho?

312
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,465
Everybody, get back!

313
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,125
Poncho, you son of a bitch!

314
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,264
You released the tuberculosis
so you could steal from me?

315
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:39,995
That's right, baby.

316
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,514
A lot of people would pay top
dollar to decimate the population.

317
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,195
I'll take the highest bidder...

318
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,525
Al-qaeda, North Korea, Republicans,
shriners, balding men that work out,

319
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,647
people on the Internet
that are only turned on...

320
00:12:52,673 --> 00:12:54,719
by cartoons of
Japanese teenagers.

321
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:59,494
Anything is better than working
for you, you pompous, negligent,

322
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,844
iTunes-gift-card-as-a-holiday-
bonus-giving mother-

323
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,625
Come on!

324
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,065
Aah!

325
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,195
Get off!

326
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,125
You guys!

327
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,394
It's gonna burst! Go!

328
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:19,465
Go, go, go!

329
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:23,419
- My foot is stuck.
- No!

330
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,524
It's okay!
It's okay. Just go.

331
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:26,764
Tell my family I love them.

332
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,825
They may be hard to
find 'cause my wife...

333
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,225
kept her last name and
she made the kids take it, too,

334
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,725
so, I-I don't know, you can-

335
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,865
No!

336
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,664
Let me ask you a
question, Ethan.

337
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:40,465
Where's the anger
coming from, man?

338
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,595
From Summer being a total bitch!

339
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,195
Where's the anger coming from?

340
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,125
My brother... took me fishing

341
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,394
once... in the bushes...

342
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:54,024
I can't... I can't...

343
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:59,095
He made me feel like a girl!
He made me a girl!

344
00:14:00,243 --> 00:14:02,424
He didn't make you
anything, man.

345
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:04,394
You are who you are.

346
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:06,394
She is who she is.

347
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,495
Now, you go to her... brand-new.

348
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,664
Come here, right now.

349
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:11,024
Oh, my God.

350
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:12,725
I'm so sorry, Ethan!
I love you!

351
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,225
I love you so much.

352
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:17,095
Um...

353
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,565
You did it again, cubbie.

354
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,894
Come here.

355
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,625
No! Stop! I hate this!

356
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,174
Well, Christmas doesn't revolve
around what you hate, son.

357
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:31,164
Well, then I hate Christmas!

358
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:32,764
Enjoy being human!

359
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:35,095
You guys are gross and lame.

360
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,664
My name's Reuben Ridley.

361
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:39,424
You're inside me right now,
but by the end of this journey...

362
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:40,394
Whoopsie.

363
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:43,265
I'll be inside all of you.

364
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,670
My story begins during the dot-com
crash in the early '90s.

365
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,725
You can put your fingers
wherever you want.

366
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,691
<i>Morty, you want to put
it on mute or something?</i>

367
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,125
I'm I'm trying to concentrate.

368
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,264
Uh... Rick?

369
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:56,229
Not now, Jerry.

370
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,365
I've got much, much
smaller fish to fry.

371
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,164
I wanted to say I'm
sorry I ever judged you.

372
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:03,325
Right now, you're
my sanest relative.

373
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,264
Relative.

374
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:05,264
Relative size!

375
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:06,924
Jerry, hand me a scalpel and a
bundle of dynamite.

376
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:08,529
Morty, can you get
to the left nipple?

377
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:09,689
Are you kidding?

378
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,390
I'm hoping I can get to both of
'em, Rick.

379
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:13,630
<i>No, Morty, I'm talking
about Reuben's left nipple.</i>

380
00:15:15,285 --> 00:15:17,565
We need to get to
the left nipple!

381
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,965
The body is decaying.

382
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,664
The arterial transit
system is useless.

383
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:23,264
We can try the service shuttle.

384
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,924
It's connected to the skeletal
system.

385
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,865
That's why we call it the bone
train.

386
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,465
Would you like to ride the
bone train, miss?

387
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,495
If it'll get us out of here.

388
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,394
How about you, Morty?

389
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,325
Would you like to
ride the bone train?

390
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,394
Why are you doing this bit?

391
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,189
We're gonna die! Let's go!

392
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:43,825
Well... I can see
you're busy.

393
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:47,424
Merry Christmas, Rick.

394
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:50,495
There's no autopilot.

395
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,788
One of us will have to stay here
and operate it manually.

396
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,865
Uh, well...

397
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,825
No, you're you're right.

398
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,910
It was a dick move for me to
even pause like that.

399
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,565
This is all my fault.
You go on.

400
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,225
What the hell is that?

401
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,095
E. Coli outbreak.

402
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:09,720
Hurry!

403
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:15,524
- Wait, there is an autopilot.
- Wait!

404
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:16,965
It's okay! Never mind!

405
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,918
I wanted to sacrifice
myself anyway!

406
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,570
They're they're chewing
through the doors!

407
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:28,664
We're in the areola,
Rick, almost to the nipple,

408
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:30,595
but we're also in a
really bad situation!

409
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,819
<i>I'm almost there, Morty!</i>

410
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:43,865
<i>Reports from all over the</i>

411
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,264
<i>country have been coming in</i>

412
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:46,924
<i>about what appears to be...</i>

413
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:50,794
a giant, naked man over the
continental United States.

414
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,495
We now go to Tom
Randolph in New York.

415
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,394
Tom?

416
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,509
Well, the eyes aren't twinkling
and the dimples aren't merry,

417
00:16:56,535 --> 00:17:00,246
but I'm standing under a nose
like a 70-mile cherry.

418
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,465
Thank you, Tom.

419
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:04,065
Let's go now to Eric
McMahan in Los Angeles.

420
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,594
We've got feet here on
the west coast, Bill,

421
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:09,825
giant feet, even relative
to the giant man's size,

422
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,595
and you know what they say
about that.

423
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,625
Well, if the old adage is true,

424
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:19,325
one can only wonder what's going
down in the rocky mountains.

425
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,464
Wha?

426
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,295
Oh my God, the track!

427
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,664
It's Hepatitis A!

428
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:36,489
Aaaah!

429
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,825
The nipple hole.

430
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,248
It's beautiful.

431
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:04,118
- Oh, no!
- Holy crap!

432
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,194
Whoa! It's Hepatitis C!

433
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,494
Um... wait did we have some
sort of relationship with him?

434
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:19,194
I think they're just like that?

435
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,964
I think they're just good guys.

436
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:23,994
Oh. Huh.

437
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,200
Where's Dr. Bloom?

438
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,795
I'm sorry, Rick, but he's dead.

439
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,548
God damn it, Morty.
I ask you to do one thing!

440
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:41,595
Jerry doesn't know what
he's missing.

441
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,994
He'll come around, Beth.
Christmas is a special time.

442
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:46,565
It has funny ways of bringing
families together.

443
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,865
I don't know, Jacob.

444
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:51,464
Jerry got an invitation to be
alive today, and he rejected it.

445
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,548
I don't know if our marriage
will...

446
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,365
It's raining blood!

447
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,595
Oh, shit. Find Jerry.

448
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,464
Oh, God.

449
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:02,130
- Jerry!
- It's all right.

450
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,865
The TV says there's nothing to
worry about.

451
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,795
The giant, naked sky Santa
has exploded.

452
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,565
Blood and chunks of viscera are
raining down on the country.

453
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,795
Everything should be fine.

454
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:14,694
Oh, yes.

455
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:16,664
Dad, can I have my phone back?

456
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,724
A sure, sweetie. Here.

457
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:20,565
Everybody, take a device.

458
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,224
It'll help you relax.

459
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:24,765
- This is nice.
- Yeah.

460
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,565
Look, I guess we really learned
something this Christmas, Jacob.

461
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:28,924
No, we didn't, dad.

462
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:30,625
No, we didn't.

463
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,894
Too bad about Dr. Bloom.

464
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:37,664
He was a genius the only man capable
of creating a new anatomy park.

465
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:39,994
Actually, I studied
Dr. Bloom's work.

466
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:42,024
I believe I have the
knowledge necessary

467
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:44,325
to create an entirely new,
much safer park.

468
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,494
What about...
Pirates of the pancreas?

469
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,811
I think it was one of the
most underrated attractions.

470
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,295
Boo-yah!
Hold your breath.

471
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,964
Hey, what the hell, Rick?!

472
00:19:54,089 --> 00:19:56,025
What the hell, man! I liked her!

473
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,565
I really had something
going there, Rick!

474
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:58,611
Yeah, so I heard.

475
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,865
You dodged a bullet,
Morty, trust me.

476
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,464
- Puffy vagina.
- What's wrong with that?

477
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:05,011
That doesn't sound like a
problem to me.

478
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:05,865
I don't know.

479
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,595
Come on, let's get
some stuffing.

480
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,394
I'm starving.

481
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,494
Oh, unbelievable.

482
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:14,965
We got we got a bunch of
robot, computer people,

483
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,895
sitting around with their faces
stuffed into computer screens.

484
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,625
Do you guys realize that Christ
was born today?

485
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,095
Jesus Christ, our savior,
was born today.

486
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,265
Are are are you people
even human?

487
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,318
What kind of Christmas is this?

488
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,924
<i>Hey, Rick?
Rick, can you hear me?</i>

489
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:00,694
Loud and clear, Annie.

490
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:01,664
<i>Great.</i>

491
00:21:01,754 --> 00:21:03,794
<i>We're also on with Alejandro,
our chief imaginarian.</i>

492
00:21:03,819 --> 00:21:04,525
<i>Hey, Rick.</i>

493
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,519
<i>Natalie Jacobs and Chris Deseter
from microscopic marketing,</i>

494
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:10,164
<i>Zack from organ concepts,
and Jamie from new media.</i>

495
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:10,964
Hey, everybody.

496
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:12,565
<i>- Hi, how's it going?
- Hi, Rick.</i>

497
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,811
<i>So, pirates of the pancreas.</i>

498
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:14,525
Yeah. Talk to me.

499
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,795
<i>Hey, Rick.
It's Alejandro speaking.</i>

500
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,625
<i>Um, so, we asked ourselves,</i>

501
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,795
<i>internally we asked
ourselves over here,</i>

502
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,324
<i>"okay, what does a
pancreas do?"</i>

503
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:25,795
<i>And the answer was,
"does it make pirates?"</i>

504
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,224
<i>No, it makes Insulin, you know?</i>

505
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:31,900
- <i>So, we're starting with a new-</i>
- Those guys are inside me, huh?

506
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,094
Like, building a park?

507
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:35,994
Those guys are inside you
building a piece of shit, Ethan!

508
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:38,299
They're inside you building a
monument to compromise!

509
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,625
Those people.

510
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,795
This whole thing, Ethan.

511
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,421
Cool.
And who pays me?

512
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:51,046
